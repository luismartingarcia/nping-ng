Ndiff

Ndiff is a tool to aid in the comparison of Nmap scans. Specifically, it
takes two Nmap XML output files and prints the differences between them:
hosts coming up and down, ports becoming open or closed, service and OS
changes.

To install, run (as root)
	python setup.py install
It's also possible to run the program from within the distribution
without installing it.

Use "ndiff --help" for usage instructions.

Here is a sample of the output:

$ ./ndiff test-scans/random-1.xml test-scans/random-2.xml

Use -v or --verbose to see all hosts and ports, not just those that have
changed.

Ndiff started as a project by Michael Pattrick <mpattrick@rhinovirus.org>
during the 2008 Google Summer of Code. Michael designed the program and
led the discussion of its output formats. He wrote versions of the
program in Perl and C++, but the summer ended shortly after it was
decided to rewrite the program in Python for the sake of Windows
compatibility. This Python version is written by David Fifield
<david@bamsoftware.com>.
