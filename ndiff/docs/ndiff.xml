    <para>
    Ndiff is a tool to aid in the comparison of Nmap scans. It takes two
    Nmap XML output files and prints the differences between them. The
    differences observed are:

    <title>Example</title>

    <para>
    Let's use Ndiff to compare the output of two Nmap scans that use
    different options. In the first, we'll do a fast scan
    (<option>-F</option>), which scans fewer ports for speed. In the
    second, we'll scan the larger default set of ports, and run an NSE
    script.
    </para>

<screen>
# nmap -F scanme.nmap.org -oX scanme-1.xml
# nmap --script=html-title scanme.nmap.org -oX scanme-2.xml
$ ndiff -v scanme-1.xml scanme-2.xml
-Nmap 4.90RC2 at 2009-07-16 13:29
+Nmap 4.90RC2 at 2009-07-16 13:33

 scanme.nmap.org (64.13.134.52):
 Host is up.
-Not shown: 95 filtered ports
+Not shown: 993 filtered ports
 PORT      STATE  SERVICE VERSION
 22/tcp    open   ssh
 25/tcp    closed smtp
 53/tcp    open   domain
+70/tcp    closed gopher
 80/tcp    open   http
+|_ html-title: Go ahead and ScanMe!
 113/tcp   closed auth
+31337/tcp closed Elite
</screen>

    <para>
    Changes are marked by a <literal>-</literal> or <literal>+</literal>
    at the beginning of a line. We can see from the output that the scan
    without the <option>-F</option> fast scan option found two
    additional ports: 70 and 31337. The
    <filename>html-title.nse</filename> script produced some additional
    output for port 80. From the port counts, we may infer that the fast
    scan scanned 100 ports (95 filtered, 3 open, and 2 closed), while
    the normal scan scanned 1000 (993 filtered, 3 open, and 4 closed).
    </para>

    <para>
    The <option>-v</option> (or <option>--verbose</option>) option to
    Ndiff made it show even the ports that didn't change, like 22 and
    25. Without <option>-v</option>, they would not have been shown.
    </para>
  </refsect1>

  <refsect1>
    <title>Output</title>

    <para>
    There are two output modes: text and XML. Text output is the
    default, and is also selected with the <option>--text</option>
    option. Text output resembles a unified diff of Nmap's normal
    terminal output. Each line is preceded by a character indicating
    whether and how it changed. <literal>-</literal> means that the line
    was in the first scan but not in the second; <literal>+</literal>
    means it was in the second but not the first. A line that changed is
    represented by a <literal>-</literal> line followed by a
    <literal>+</literal> line. Lines that did not change are preceded by
    a blank space.
    </para>

    <para>
    <xref linkend="ndiff-man-ex-text-output"/> is an example of text
    output.
    </para>

</screen>
    </example>

    <para>
    XML output, intended to be processed by other programs, is selected
    with the <option>--xml</option> option. It is based on Nmap's XML
    output, with a few additional elements to indicate differences. The
    XML document is enclosed in <varname>nmapdiff</varname> and
    <varname>scandiff</varname> elements. Host differences are enclosed
    in <varname>hostdiff</varname> tags and port differences are
    enclosed in <varname>portdiff</varname> tags. Inside a
    <varname>hostdiff</varname> or <varname>portdiff</varname>,
    <varname>a</varname> and <varname>b</varname> tags show the state of
    the host or port in the first scan (<varname>a</varname>) or the
    second scan (<varname>b</varname>).

    Using Nmap, Ndiff, cron, and a shell script, it's possible to scan a

    changes since the previous scan.

    together.

    <title>History</title>

    <para>
    Ndiff started as a project by Michael Pattrick during the 2008
    Google Summer of Code. Michael designed the program and led the
    discussion of its output formats. He wrote versions of the program
    in Perl and C++, but the summer ended shortly after it was decided
    to rewrite the program in Python for the sake of Windows (and
    Zenmap) compatibility. This Python version was written by David
    Fifield.  James Levine <ulink url="http://seclists.org/nmap-hackers/2000/0315.html">released</ulink> a Perl script named Ndiff with
    similar functionality in 2000.
