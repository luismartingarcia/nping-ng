If you are reading this file you have probably just seen an error like
this after updating:

svn: URL 'svn://svn.insecure.org/nping' of existing directory 'nping'
does not match expected URL 'svn://svn.insecure.org/nmap/nping'

This is caused by the replacement of SVN externals.

Here's what you need to do. First, save any local changes you might have
in the nping, nsock, nbase, ncat, and zenmap directories. (For example
by running "cd nping; svn diff > ../nping.diff".) If you don't have any
local changes you can skip this step.

Then run these commands:

rm -rf nping/ nsock/ nbase/ ncat/ zenmap/
svn update
svn cleanup

If all else fails, you can just delete your whole working directory and
check out anew:

svn co --username guest --password "" svn://svn.insecure.org/nmap
