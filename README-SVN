After r27443 the Nmap Subversion repository was moved. To update your
working directory, run this command:

~/nmap$ svn switch --relocate svn://svn.insecure.org/nmap https://svn.nmap.org/nmap

If you get errors in the nbase, ncat, nping, nsock, and zenmap
directories after updating, then delete those directories and update
again.

~/nmap$ rm -rf nbase ncat nping nsock zenmap
~/nmap$ svn update
