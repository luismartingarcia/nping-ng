How to upgrade Nmap to a new WinPcap release (2007)
---------------------------------------------------

1) Download the latest version of WinPcap from www.winpcap.org and make
   a note of the version (for example 4.0).

2) Remove all instances of WinPcap (through Add/Remove Programs), then
   install the new version.

   2a) Update the LICENSE file, if necessary. I couldn't find a plain
      WinPcap license file anywhere. There's an HTML version at
      http://www.winpcap.org/misc/copyright.htm. You can copy and paste
      the license text from the installer into the LICENSE file.

3) Copy the installed files into the mswin32/winpcap directory. The
   installed files at time of writing are

        C:\Program Files\WinPcap\rpcapd.exe
        C:\Windows\system32\Packet.dll
        C:\Windows\system32\pthreadVC.dll
        C:\Windows\system32\WanPacket.dll
        C:\Windows\system32\wpcap.dll
        C:\Windows\system32\drivers\npf.sys
   
4) Copy the Vista version of Packet.dll. This is tricky because there
   are several (three, as of this writing) versions of Packet.dll in the
   installer but only one is installed at a time. You can see all the
   versions by opening the installer with 7-Zip (http://www.7-zip.org/).
   Select the installer within 7-Zip and click "File", "Open Inside".
   Enter the $SYSDIR subdirectory. One by one, extract (you can drag and
   drop) the copies of Packet.dll somewhere. Right-click on each
   Packet.dll, click "Properties", then select the "Version" tab. The
   "Description:" field will have a string containing "NT4", "NT5", or
   "Vista". When you find the Vista file copy it to vista/Packet.dll.

5) Open winpcap-nmap.nsi.
   5a) Change the version for the following lines:

        Name "WinPcap (Nmap) X.X"
        OutFile "winpcap-nmap-X.X.exe
        WriteRegStr HKLM "Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\winpcap-nmap" "DisplayName" "winpcap-nmap X.X"

   5b) Get the internal 'FileVersion' from wpcap.dll. Right-click on
      wpcap.dll and select "Properties", then select the "Version" tab.
      Copy the number there into this part of winpcap-nmap.nsi:

        var /GLOBAL my_ver
        StrCpy $my_ver "X.X.X.X"  <-- file version goes here

6) Generate installer exe by compiling winpcap-nmap.nsi using the
   running the command
        makensis winpcap-nmap.nsi
   makensis is part of the "Nullsoft Scriptable Install System" at
   http://nsis.sourceforge.net/.

7) Give the installer a test, make sure the correct version appears in
   the installer's name and in Add/Remove Programs. You may also want to
   try installing it when it is already installed or an older version is
   installed.

8) Open mswin32/nsis/Nmap.nsi and update the references to the winpcap
   installer's name. You should only have to change the version number.
   The section you need to look at starts like this:
        Section "WinPcap X.X" SecWinPcap

9) Download the WinPcap developer package
   (http://www.winpcap.org/devel.htm) and replace all the files in
   mswin32/lib/ with the new versions inside the package.

10) Build the Nmap installer. The best way to do this is to run "make" in
   the mswin32 directory. This will build Nmap and run makensis for you.
   Test the installer. You may want to try it with Nmap already
   installed and with different versions installed. Also check that
   everything appears in Add/Remove Programs correctly.

11) Test Nmap functionallity that uses WinPcap (raw packet scans, raw
   packet pings, traceroute).

12) Sit back and have a cup of coffee, you deserve it :)
