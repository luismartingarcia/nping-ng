# * The Nmap Security Scanner is (C) 1996-2012 Insecure.Com LLC. Nmap is    *
# * also a registered trademark of Insecure.Com LLC.  This program is free  *

# * GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software            *
# * Foundation; Version 2 with the clarifications and exceptions described  *
# * below.  This guarantees your right to use, modify, and redistribute     *
# * this software under certain conditions.  If you wish to embed Nmap      *
# * technology into proprietary software, we sell alternative licenses      *
# * (contact sales@insecure.com).  Dozens of software vendors already       *
# * license Nmap technology such as host discovery, port scanning, OS       *
# * detection, version detection, and the Nmap Scripting Engine.            *
# *                                                                         *
# * Note that the GPL places important restrictions on "derived works", yet *
# * it does not provide a detailed definition of that term.  To avoid       *
# * misunderstandings, we interpret that term as broadly as copyright law   *
# * allows.  For example, we consider an application to constitute a        *
# * "derivative work" for the purpose of this license if it does any of the *
# * following:                                                              *
# * o Integrates source code from Nmap                                      *
# * o Reads or includes Nmap copyrighted data files, such as                *
# *   nmap-os-db or nmap-service-probes.                                    *
# * o Executes Nmap and parses the results (as opposed to typical shell or  *
# *   execution-menu apps, which simply display raw Nmap output and so are  *
# *   not derivative works.)                                                *
# * o Integrates/includes/aggregates Nmap into a proprietary executable     *
# *   installer, such as those produced by InstallShield.                   *
# * o Links to a library or executes a program that does any of the above   *
# *                                                                         *
# * The term "Nmap" should be taken to also include any portions or derived *
# * works of Nmap, as well as other software we distribute under this       *
# * license such as Zenmap, Ncat, and Nping.  This list is not exclusive,   *
# * but is meant to clarify our interpretation of derived works with some   *
# * common examples.  Our interpretation applies only to Nmap--we don't     *
# * speak for other people's GPL works.                                     *
# *                                                                         *
# * If you have any questions about the GPL licensing restrictions on using *
# * Nmap in non-GPL works, we would be happy to help.  As mentioned above,  *
# * we also offer alternative license to integrate Nmap into proprietary    *
# * applications and appliances.  These contracts have been sold to dozens  *
# * of software vendors, and generally include a perpetual license as well  *
# * as providing for priority support and updates.  They also fund the      *
# * continued development of Nmap.  Please email sales@insecure.com for     *
# * further information.                                                    *
# *                                                                         *
# * As a special exception to the GPL terms, Insecure.Com LLC grants        *
# * permission to link the code of this program with any version of the     *
# * OpenSSL library which is distributed under a license identical to that  *
# * listed in the included docs/licenses/OpenSSL.txt file, and distribute   *
# * linked combinations including the two. You must obey the GNU GPL in all *
# * respects for all of the code used other than OpenSSL.  If you modify    *
# * this file, you may extend this exception to your version of the file,   *
# * but you are not obligated to do so.                                     *
# *                                                                         *
# * If you received these files with a written license agreement or         *
# * contract stating terms other than the terms above, then that            *
# * alternative license agreement takes precedence over these comments.     *
# *                                                                         *
# * Source is provided to this software because we believe users have a     *
# * right to know exactly what a program is going to do before they run it. *
# * This also allows you to audit the software for security holes (none     *
# * have been found so far).                                                *
# *                                                                         *
# * Source code also allows you to port Nmap to new platforms, fix bugs,    *
# * and add new features.  You are highly encouraged to send your changes   *
# * to the dev@nmap.org mailing list for possible incorporation into the    *
# * main distribution.  By sending these changes to Fyodor or one of the    *
# * Insecure.Org development mailing lists, or checking them into the Nmap  *
# * source code repository, it is understood (unless you specify otherwise) *
# * that you are offering the Nmap Project (Insecure.Com LLC) the           *
# * unlimited, non-exclusive right to reuse, modify, and relicense the      *
# * code.  Nmap will always be available Open Source, but this is important *
# * because the inability to relicense code has caused devastating problems *
# * for other Free Software projects (such as KDE and NASM).  We also       *
# * occasionally relicense the code to third parties as discussed above.    *
# * If you wish to specify special license conditions of your               *
# * contributions, just say so when you send them.                          *
# *                                                                         *
