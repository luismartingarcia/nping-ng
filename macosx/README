This is a test packaging of Nmap and Zenmap for Mac OS X. It is meant to
work on both Intel and PowerPC Macs running Mac OS X 10.4 or later.

We are distributing this in the hope of creating a really great
distribution of Nmap and Zenmap on the Mac, and for that we need your
help. Please try it out and send comments and suggestions to
nmap-dev@insecure.org.

The nmap command-line binary will be installed in /usr/local/bin, and
additional support files will be installed in /usr/local/libexec and
/usr/local/share.

Zenmap is installed as an application bundle in
/Applications/Zenmap.app.

Known issues:

Zenmap doesn't run as root. Work to allow this is underway. A workaround
is to peek inside the application bundle:
	sudo /Applications/Zenmap.app/Contents/MacOS/zenmap

Changes in the test package:

zenmap-4.60-test1 (April 8, 2008)
	Initial release. Distributed as a disk image containing the
	Zenmap application bundle only.

nmap-4.60-test2 (April 30, 2008)
	Now a metapackage that installs both Nmap and Zenmap. Built
	against MacPorts 1.7.0, targeting Mac OS X 10.4 with the 10.4u
	SDK. Zenmap looks for nmap in /usr/local/bin by default. More
	careful escaping of configuration files allows running from a
	directory with spaces in the name.

nmap-4.60-test3 (May 2, 2008)
	Fixes a syntax error with Python 2.3. This version is linked
	against a version of GLib that is patched to work on PowerPC.

nmap-4.62-test4 (May 3, 2008)
	This release is built with upstream py2app, not the version that
	Apple distributes. The Apple version is build to run only on Mac
	OS X 10.5.

nmap-4.62-test5 (May 8, 2008)
	This release is built against the X11 libraries from the 10.4u
	SDK.

nmap-4.62-test6 (May 9, 2008)
	This release fixes two libraries that were being built against
	the 10.5 SDK: OpenSSL and Cairo.

nmap-4.62-test7 (May 10, 2008)
	This release attempts to automatically launch X11 if it's not
	already running.
