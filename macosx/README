This is a test packaging of Nmap and Zenmap for Mac OS X.

We are distributing this in the hope of creating a really great
distribution of Nmap and Zenmap on the Mac, and for that we need your
help. Please try it out and send comments and suggestions to
nmap-dev@insecure.org.

Known issues:

Zenmap doesn't run as root. I haven't found a convenient way to run it
as root. You can do it by peeking inside the application bundle:
	sudo /Volumes/Zenmap-4.60/Zenmap.app/Contents/MacOS/zenmap
But there has to be a better way. Please write nmap-dev@insecure.org if
you have suggestions.
