This is a test packaging of Zenmap for Mac OS X.

We are distributing this in the hope of creating a really great
distribution of Nmap and Zenmap on the Mac, and for that we need your
help. Please try it out and send comments and suggestions to
nmap-dev@insecure.org.

This package does not come with Nmap itself. Zenmap and Nmap may be
bundled together in the future depending on what users recommend. You
need to install Nmap separately. Make sure it is in your system PATH;
see below. Please write nmap-dev@insecure.org if you have an idea for a
good way to package Nmap and Zenmap together.

Known issues:

Zenmap doesn't run as root. I haven't found a convenient way to run it
as root. You can do it by peeking inside the application bundle:
	sudo /Volumes/Zenmap-4.60/Zenmap.app/Contents/MacOS/zenmap
But there has to be a better way. Please write nmap-dev@insecure.org if
you have suggestions.

/usr/local/bin is not in the default PATH. As mentioned above, currently
you have to install Nmap separately. When Nmap is compiled from source,
by default it is installed in /usr/local/bin. But /usr/local/bin is
*not* in the default OS X PATH! You will see an error in Zenmap:
"[Errno 2] No such file or directory". I don't recommend installing Nmap
with a prefix of /usr, but you can make a symbolic link from
/usr/bin/nmap to /usr/local/bin/nmap and it will work fine.

Running the application from a directory whose name contains a space
fails. The wrapper scripts necessary to package GTK+ and Pango need to
carefully escape paths in the files they write.
