This is a test packaging of Nmap and Zenmap for Mac OS X. It is meant to
work on both Intel and PowerPC Macs running Mac OS X 10.4 or later.

We are distributing this in the hope of creating a really great
distribution of Nmap and Zenmap on the Mac, and for that we need your
help. Please try it out and send comments and suggestions to
nmap-dev@insecure.org.

The nmap command-line binary will be installed in /usr/local/bin, and
additional support files will be installed in /usr/local/libexec and
/usr/local/share.

Zenmap is installed as an application bundle in
/Applications/Zenmap.app.

Known issues:

Zenmap doesn't run as root. Work to allow this is underway. A workaround
is to peek inside the application bundle:
	sudo /Applications/Zenmap.app/Contents/MacOS/zenmap
