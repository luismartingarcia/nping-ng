Nmap is a free and open source utility for network exploration and security auditing. Zenmap is a multi-platform graphical frontend and results viewer for Nmap.

This package contains Nmap and Zenmap. It is intended to work on Intel and PowerPC Macs running Mac OS X 10.4 or later.

Installation of both Nmap and Zenmap is optional. Unselect Zenmap to get just the command-line tool. Unselect Nmap if you prefer to use a copy of Nmap that is already installed. Zenmap will not work without Nmap.

The nmap command-line binary will be installed in /usr/local/bin, and additional support files will be installed in /usr/local/libexec and /usr/local/share. The Zenmap application bundle will be installed in /Applications/Zenmap.app.
