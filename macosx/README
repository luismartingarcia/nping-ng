Nmap is a free and open source utility for network exploration and security auditing. Zenmap is a multi-platform graphical frontend and results viewer for Nmap. Ncat is a general-purpose network sending and receiving utility, a reimplementation of Netcat.

This package contains Nmap, Zenmap, and Ncat. It is intended to work on Intel and PowerPC Macs running Mac OS X 10.4 or later.

Installation of all three packages is optional. Unselect Zenmap to get just the command-line tools. You can unselect Nmap if you want to use Zenmap with a copy of Nmap that is already installed. Zenmap will not work without Nmap.

The nmap and ncat command-line binaries will be installed in /usr/local/bin, and additional support files will be installed in /usr/local/share. The Zenmap application bundle will be installed in /Applications/Zenmap.app.
