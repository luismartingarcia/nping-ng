o Use a more efficient algorithm to update the display of Nmap normal
  output in live scans.
  zenmapGUI.NmapOutputViewer.NmapOutputViewer.refresh_output calls
  zenmapCore.NmapCommand.NmapCommand.get_output, which re-reads the
  entire output file (into memory) and then puts it in the text buffer
  if it has changed. So already we're storing the whole output twice in
  memory. When the text field changes, update_output_colors
  re-highlights the whole file.

  It should instead only read new text at the end of the output file and
  append it to what's already in the text buffer.
