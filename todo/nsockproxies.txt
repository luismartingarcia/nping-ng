TODO/ideas for nsock proxy support:


o Authentication

o Handle socks4a
  - This requires to figure out how to trigger proxy code without resolving
    target hostname first. The problem is that the proxy code is supposed to be
    a transparent hook of connect()... Extending the exported API will probably
    be needed :(
  - If nsock could provide async hostname resolution methods, we could do some
    clever tricks...

o Explore ways to share code with ncat
