GSoC 2011 TASKS:

o Finish the HTTP architecture ideas draft and submit it to nmap-dev.

o Work on my GSoC vulnerability and exploitation script ideas:
  https://secwiki.org/w/Nmap/Script_Ideas#Djalal_Harouni

o Start a thread on Nmap-dev about users favorite Nmap and NSE commands,
  and create a special page for it in the secwiki.org site.
  This will also let us to create more scan profiles for Zenmap.

==

1) Nmap Scripting Engine Infrastructure:

o NSE Version Numbering.
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q4/693

[Other tasks]
o Propose a better duplicate scanned IPs filtering engine.


2) NSE Scripts:

[Priorities tasks]
o NFS/RPC features:
- add NFS READLINK support to let nfs-ls show symbolic files.

o Review NSE scripts and libs, and fixing bugs:
 - Document all the new NFS procedures.

[Other tasks]
o NFS/RPC features:
- Add more authentication support: Unix authentication.
- NFSv4 support.
- Add recursion support to nfs-ls.nse


==

MAYBE:

o Create a new rule "versionrule" which will be used by version
  category scripts.
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q3/551

o NSE debugger.

o Add more NSE control for long running scripts: one option will be a
boolean expression filter (like: tcpdump) which will change NSE scripts
arguments or behaviour according to previous results, this will be
really useful for big networks. Another option will be a generic NSE
(Lua) script with an easy and readable code that includes expressions or
filters selection to let us change NSE arguments according to previous
results.
Note: this option will be useful on big networks. however for the moment
this is a simple idea and it needs further discussion on the nmap-dev.

o Privileges dropping for NSE scripts [nmap TODO list].

o NSE security review [nmap TODO list].


o Fixing bugs.
- NSE not honoring the source port flag when doing version scan.
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q2/576
  
  David said that it will not be easy to support setting the source port

DONE:

1) Nmap Scripting Engine Infrastructure:

o Make NSE scripts able to retrieve the interface network
  information.
  
o LuaFileSystem directory iterator [1] port.
[1] http://keplerproject.github.com/luafilesystem/

o New class of scripts which use two new script rules:
 - Script Pre-scanning and Script Post-scanning rules: "prerule" and
   "postrule". Documented these new phases.
 - Update scripts to use these new rules:
   dns-zone-transfer now uses "prerule" and "portrule".

o Update other parts of Nmap book to show the new Script scan phases.

o Fixing bugs:
 - NSE not honoring the Exclude directive bug fixed and committed 
   as r18467.

o Let NSE "prerule", "portrule" and "hostrule" scripts to add new
discoverd targets to Nmap.

o Update scripting.xml to show the new script scan phases.

2) NSE Scripts:

o NFS/RPC features:
 - New script: nfs-ls which combines nfs-dirlist and nfs-acls and try to
   emulates some features of the old "ls" unix tool. The script support
   NFSv2 and NFSv3.
 - Readapted the RPC and NFS library code with a new re-design with new
   high level functions.
 - Added NFS procedures support:
   NFSv2: LOOKUP
   NFSv3: FSSTAT, FSINFO, READDIRPLUS, PATHCONF, ACCESS, LOOKUP
