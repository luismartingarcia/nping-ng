GSoC 2011 participation: Discovery and miscelaneous script specialist 
=====

Work in progress:

* ip-geolocation method research and script development

=====

ToDo:

* broadcast-ping.nse
* Selection of discovery script candidates 
* Set up virtual machine so I don't install servers localy (Arch?)

=====

Maybe (the ones with ** aren't on the Script_Ideas Page yet)

** faceniff-discovery
http://faceniff.ponury.net/
Try if Faceniff can be detected using similar methods to firesheep

** targets-lltd (and perhaps otherscripts)
** lltd-info (?)
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_Layer_Topology_Discovery

** targets-lldp
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_Layer_Discovery_Protocol

** disjunctive-traceroute + target add 
http://ccr.sigcomm.org/online/?q=node/398

* firesheep-discovery
http://research.zscaler.com/2010/11/detecting-firesheep.html

* Bonjour / mdns / llmnr etc. 
(DNS protocols support) + backscatter into dns scripts where applicable

* targets-asn 
John Bond is working on this. It's called asn-to-prefixes. Perhaps I could 
review it, asist so it makes its way to the library faster? On the other hand
there already are a couple of people assisting.

* targets-dhcp
dhcp-discover as a prerule, so it doesn't run by default. But it doesn't run by 
default. It's discovery, intrusive, but not default. Maybe just add the prerule 
there, and some way of forcibly initiating the prerule (like an argument).

* imap-brute
The library will need to be extended.

* hnap-info 
* hnap-auth-bypass
A nice hnap library would be fitting, that will make these scripts a breeze. 
I'd need testing equipment, or some :S implementation.

* snmp-brute port to brute framework
There are a couple of default passwords that snmp-brute uses atm which should be
considered even when it's the brute.lua is used

* pop-brute port to brute fraework

* vuze-dht-version
* bittorrent-dht-nodes
* bgpmon-info
* Nbstat.nse -> change to using a broadcast prerule
* SSL renegotiation
* soap.lua
* xmlrpc.lua

=====

Completed:

* snmp-interfaces patch related to mac-geolocation
* mac-geolocation
* stdnse.lua: in_port_range()
* backorifice-brute
* backorifice-info
