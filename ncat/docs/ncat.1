.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Ncat is a feature\-packed networking utility which reads and writes data across networks from the command line\&. Ncat was written for the Nmap Project and is the culmination of the currently splintered family of Netcat incarnations\&. It is designed to be a reliable back\-end tool to instantly provide network connectivity to other applications and users\&. Ncat will not only work with IPv4 and IPv6 but provides the user with a virtually limitless number of potential uses\&.
.PP
Among Ncat\*(Aqs vast number of features there is the ability to chain Ncats together; redirection of TCP, UDP, and SCTP ports to other sites; SSL support; and proxy connections via SOCKS4 or HTTP proxies (with optional proxy authentication as well)\&. Some general principles apply to most applications and thus give you the capability of instantly adding networking support to software that would normally never support it\&.

.SH "CONNECT MODE AND LISTEN MODE"
.\" connect mode (Ncat)
.\" client mode (Ncat)
.\" listen mode (Ncat)
.\" server mode (Ncat)
.PP
Ncat operates in one of two primary modes: connect mode and listen mode\&. Other modes, such as the HTTP proxy server, act as special cases of these two\&. In connect mode, Ncat works as a client\&. In listen mode it is a server\&.
.PP
In connect mode, the
\fB\fIhostname\fR\fR
and
\fB\fIport\fR\fR
arguments tell what to connect to\&.
\fB\fIhostname\fR\fR
is required, and may be a hostname or IP address\&. If
\fB\fIport\fR\fR
is supplied, it must be a decimal port number\&. If omitted, it defaults to 31337\&..\" default port of Ncat.\" 31337
.PP
In listen mode,
\fB\fIhostname\fR\fR
and
\fB\fIport\fR\fR
control the address the server will bind to\&. Both arguments are optional in listen mode\&. If
\fB\fIhostname\fR\fR
is omitted, it defaults to listening on all available addresses over IPv4 and IPv6\&. If
\fB\fIport\fR\fR
is omitted, it defaults to 31337\&.
.SH "PROTOCOL OPTIONS"

.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-sctp\fR (Use SCTP) .\" --sctp (Ncat option)
.RS 4
Use SCTP for the connection (the default is TCP)\&. SCTP support is implemented in TCP\-compatible mode\&.

.PP
\fB\-g \fR\fB\fIhop1\fR\fR\fB[,\fIhop2\fR,\&.\&.\&.]\fR (Loose source routing) .\" -g (Ncat option)
.RS 4
Sets hops for IPv4 loose source routing\&. You can use
\fB\-g\fR
once with a comma\-separated list of hops, use
\fB\-g\fR
multiple times with single hops to build the list, or combine the two\&. Hops can be given as IP addresses or hostnames\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-G \fR\fB\fIptr\fR\fR (Set source routing pointer) .\" -G (Ncat option)
.RS 4
Sets the IPv4 source route

for information on limiting the hosts that may connect to the listening Ncat process\&.
.PP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-listen\fR (Listen for connections) .\" --listen (Ncat option) .\" -l (Ncat option)

.RS 4
The maximum number of simultaneous connections accepted by an Ncat instance\&. 100 is the default\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-k\fR, \fB\-\-keep\-open\fR (Accept multiple connections) .\" --keep-open (Ncat option) .\" -k (Ncat option)
.RS 4
Normally a listening server accepts only one connection and then quits when the connection is closed\&. This option makes it accept multiple simultaneous connections and wait for more connections after they have all been closed\&. It must be combined with
\fB\-\-listen\fR\&. In this mode there is no way for Ncat to know when its network input is finished, so it will keep running until interrupted\&. This also means that it will never close its output stream, so any program reading from Ncat and looking for end\-of\-file will also hang\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-broker\fR (Connection brokering) .\" --broker (Ncat option)
.RS 4
Allow multiple parties to connect to a centralised Ncat server and communicate with each other\&. Ncat can broker communication between systems that are behind a NAT or otherwise unable to directly connect\&. This option is used in conjunction with
\fB\-\-listen\fR, which causes the
\fB\-\-listen\fR
port to have broker mode enabled\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-chat\fR (Ad\-hoc \(lqchat server\(rq) .\" --chat (Ncat option)
.RS 4
The
\fB\-\-chat\fR
option enables chat mode, intended for the exchange of text between several users\&. In chat mode, connection brokering is turned on\&. Ncat prefixes each message received with an ID before relaying it to the other connections\&. The ID is unique for each connected client\&. This helps distinguish who sent what\&. Additionally, non\-printing characters such as control characters are escaped to keep them from doing damage to a terminal\&.
.RE
.SH "SSL OPTIONS"
.PP
\fB\-\-ssl\fR (Use SSL) .\" --ssl (Ncat option)
.RS 4
In connect mode, this option transparently negotiates an SSL session with an SSL server to securely encrypt the connection\&. This is particularly handy for talking to SSL enabled HTTP servers, etc\&.
.sp
In server mode, this option listens for incoming SSL connections, rather than plain untunneled traffic\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-ssl\-verify\fR (Verify server certificates) .\" --ssl-verify (Ncat option)
.RS 4
In client mode,
\fB\-\-ssl\-verify\fR
is like
\fB\-\-ssl\fR
except that it also requires verification of the server certificate\&. Ncat comes with a default set of trusted certificates in the file
ca\-bundle\&.crt.\" ca-bundle.crt\&. Some operating systems provide a default list of trusted certificates; these will also be used if available\&. Use
\fB\-\-ssl\-trustfile\fR
to give a custom list\&. Use
\fB\-v\fR
one or more times to get details about verification failures\&.
.\" revoked certificates
Ncat does not check for revoked certificates.\" certification revocation\&.
.sp
This option has no effect in server mode\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-ssl\-cert \fR\fB\fIcertfile\&.pem\fR\fR (Specify SSL certificate) .\" --ssl-cert (Ncat option)
.RS 4
This option gives the location of a PEM\-encoded certificate files used to authenticate the server (in listen mode) or the client (in connect mode)\&. Use it in combination with
\fB\-\-ssl\-key\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-ssl\-key \fR\fB\fIkeyfile\&.pem\fR\fR (Specify SSL private key) .\" --ssl-key (Ncat option)
.RS 4
This option gives the location of the PEM\-encoded private key file that goes with the certificate named with
\fB\-\-ssl\-cert\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-ssl\-trustfile \fR\fB\fIcert\&.pem\fR\fR (List trusted certificates) .\" --ssl-trustfile (Ncat option)
.RS 4
This option sets a list of certificates that are trusted for purposes of certificate verification\&. It has no effect unless combined with
\fB\-\-ssl\-verify\fR\&. The argument to this option is the name of a PEM.\" PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail)
file containing trusted certificates\&. Typically, the file will contain certificates of certification authorities, though it may also contain server certificates directly\&. When this option is used, Ncat does not use its default certificates\&.
.RE
.SH "PROXY OPTIONS"
.PP
\fB\-\-proxy \fR\fB\fIhost\fR\fR\fB[:\fR\fB\fIport\fR\fR\fB]\fR (Specify proxy address) .\" --proxy (Ncat option)
.RS 4
Requests proxying through
\fIhost\fR:\fIport\fR, using the protocol specified by
\fB\-\-proxy\-type\fR\&.
.sp
If no port is specified, the proxy protocol\*(Aqs well\-known port is used (1080 for SOCKS and 3128 for HTTP)\&. However, when specifying an IPv6 HTTP proxy server using the IP address rather than the hostname, the port number MUST be specified as well\&. If the proxy requires authentication, use
\fB\-\-proxy\-auth\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-proxy\-type \fR\fB\fIproto\fR\fR (Specify proxy protocol) .\" --proxy-type (Ncat option)
.RS 4
In connect mode, this option requests the protocol
\fIproto\fR
to connect through the proxy host specified by
\fB\-\-proxy\fR\&. In listen mode, this option has Ncat act as a proxy server using the specified protocol\&.
.sp
The currently available protocols in connect mode are
http
(CONNECT) and
socks4
(SOCKSv4)\&. The only server currently supported is
http\&. If this option is not used, the default protocol is
http\&.
.RE
.PP

In connect mode, gives the credentials that will be used to connect to the proxy server\&. In listen mode, gives the credentials that will be required of connecting clients\&. For use with
\fB\-\-proxy\-type http\fR, the form should be user:pass\&. For
\fB\-\-proxy\-type socks4\fR, it should be a username only\&.

\fB\-e \fR\fB\fIcommand\fR\fR, \fB\-\-exec \fR\fB\fIcommand\fR\fR (Execute command) .\" --exec (Ncat option) .\" -e (Ncat option)
.RS 4
Execute the specified command after a connection has been established\&. The command must be specified as a full pathname\&. All input from the remote client will be sent to the application and responses sent back to the remote client over the socket, thus making your command\-line application interactive over a socket\&. Combined with
\fB\-\-keep\-open\fR, Ncat will handle multiple simultaneous connections to your specified port/application like inetd\&. Ncat will only accept a maximum, definable, number of simultaneous connections controlled by the

Read this full manual page as well\&. If nothing comes of this, mail a bug report to
nmap\-dev@insecure\&.org\&. Please include everything you have learned about the problem, as well as what version of Ncat you are running and what operating system version it is running on\&. Problem reports and Ncat usage questions sent to nmap\-dev@insecure\&.org are far more likely to be answered than those sent to Fyodor directly\&.

Code patches to fix bugs are even better than bug reports\&. Basic instructions for creating patch files with your changes are available at
\m[blue]\fB\%https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/HACKING\fR\m[]\&. Patches may be sent to
nmap\-dev
(recommended) or to Fyodor directly\&.

The original Netcat was written by *Hobbit*
hobbit@avian\&.org\&. While Ncat isn\*(Aqt built on any code from the
\(lqtraditional\(rq
Netcat (or any other implementation), Ncat is most definitely based on Netcat in spirit and functionality\&.
