This is a list of fine folks who help bring you Nmap! But not an
exclusive list, as many people who contribute greatly to Nmap are not
committers.  See the CHANGELOG (http://nmap.org/changelog.html) for a
broader list of contributions.

These people have earned commit access to the Nmap SVN repository and
can check changes directly into the Nmap trunk.  Significant
changes/patches are generally discussed on nmap-dev first to catch
problems and improve the implementation with new ideas.  These people
can also create /nmap-exp branches to pursue larger/experimental ideas
without destabilizing the Nmap trunk in the process.

Most people are added as a committer after they establish a history of
writing so much code that it is easier for the existing committers to
add them to the group than continue manually applying their patches
:). So the best way to become one is to keep sending good patches to
nmap-dev. But if you want to expedite the process, and you already
have a track record of many patches integrated into Nmap, feel free to
mail Fyodor.

Committers added temporarily for a project (such as Summer of Code
students) are not included in this list.  Committers who are inactive
for years will have their accounts disabled for security reasons, but
they will be happily re-enabled upon request.
