                   Building the Nmap Installer for Windows
                   =======================================


I. ZENMAP BUILD DEPENDENCIES

Here are the build dependencies for Zenmap and where to get them.  The
latest known tested versions are listed here, but I usually start by
grabbing the latest version available on the sites rather than these
known-good versions.

GTK+ All-in-one bundle
  o http://www.gtk.org/download-windows.html
  o Tested: gtk+-bundle_2.22.1-20101227_win32.zip
Python
  o http://www.python.org/download
  o Tested: python-2.7.1.msi
GTK+, PyGTK, PyGObject, PyCairo
  o http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/binaries/win32/pygtk
  o Tested: 2.24/pygtk-all-in-one-2.24.2.win32-py2.7.msi
Py2exe (0.6.9) - http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/py2exe/files/
  o Tested: py2exe-0.6.9.win32-py2.7.exe

The GTK all-in-one bundle is a zip file.  Unzip it into the directory
c:\GTK.  The other components have installers-using the default
install directories is important, especially for Python (C:\Python27)
and GTK (C:\GTK).  See Section IV if you must change the directories.

You may need to set your Windows $PATH so that it can find the GTK
DLLs while py2exe is doing its thing.  On Windows 7 x64, I did this as
follows:
 o Open control panel, search for "environment variables", click on
   "Edit the system environment variables", which opens the "System
   Properties" dialogue.  Select the "Advanced" tab then click the
   "Environment Variables" button.  Add ";C:\GTK\bin" to the end of
   the user PATH variable.

II. OTHER REQUIREMENTS

You'll need Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 for compilation.
Directions for obtaining that are at:
http://nmap.org/install/inst-windows.html#inst-win-source

You'll also need Cygwin installed in order to build the Nmap installer (not
required for normal compiling).  You'll find it at http://www.cygwin.com

And last, you'll need the Nullsoft Scriptable Install System installed.  You
can download if from http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Download  (Version
2.46 tested). Install in "C:\Program Files\NSIS" even if it offers
"C:\Program Files (x86)\NSIS".


III. BUILDING

With all of the requirements and dependencies installed, open up a Cygwin
shell and go to the mswin32 directory in the Nmap directory and type "make".
This may take several minutes, and will create an executable installer and a
zip archive (nmap-<version>-setup.exe and nmap-<version>-win32.zip).


IV. INSTALLATION PATHS / PROBLEMS

If you have Python installed to a directory other than the default mentioned
above, then you need to edit the copy_and_compile.bat file under
zenmap/install_scripts/windows and change the "set PythonEXE" line with your
installed directory.

If you have GTK installed to a different directory, follow the same directions
as for Python, but edit the "set GTKDir" line.
