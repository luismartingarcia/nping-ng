general purpose
This category contains general-purpose operating systems like Linux and
Windows. In the nmap-service-probes file this class is indicated by a
lack of a
d//<indexterm><primary><literal>d//</literal> (device type) version detection field</primary></indexterm>
field.

bridge (15)
A bridge combines two or more subnetworks into one. With a bridge this
happens at a lower level than with a router.

broadband router (241)
A consumer device for connecting a network to the internet via cable, ADSL, fiber optics, etc. May provide services like Network Address Translation (NAT), a firewall, port forwarding, etc. 
*** Possibly split into "broadband router" and "broadband modem" where modem counts only devices that actually plug into a cable or DSL connection

firewall (128)
A device dedicated to protecting other devices or networks. Usually these devices use inbound packet filtering but also may use outbound filtering or application level filtering.

game console (16)
A consumer entertainment device intended primarily for playing video games. Examples are Nintendo, Xbox, PlayStation, etc.

hub (1)
A device that joins 2 or more network segments by re-broadcasting all traffic. These devices are distinct from switches which selectively transmit packets only to relevant destinations.

load balancer (17)
A device that distributes inbound traffic to multiple devices to ease the load on those devices.

media device (150)
A consumer device for watching media such as movies, television, pictures, etc. Examples: satellite TV systems, Video Disk Recorders (VDRs), music streaming devices.

PBX (21)
Private Branch eXchanges are devices used for routing telephone calls to multiple phones in an organization. The telephones may be connected via Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS) or Voice Over IP (VoIP).

PDA (12)
Portable Digital Assistants are handheld consumer devices used for organization, browsing the mobile web, playing games, etc.

phone (22)
Network-capable telephones that are not VoIP phones. Devices in this category are typically mobile phones.

power device (45)
These are devices such as Uninterruptable Power Supplies (UPSs) or high-end surge protectors usually intended for data-centres.

printer (371)
Network-enabled printers, including printers with an embedded print
server.

print server (100)
A print server connects a printer to a network. Printers that contain
their own print server go in the "printer" category instead.

proxy server (13)
Any kind of proxy server, including web proxies and other devices that, for example, cache data or understand other high-level protocols.

remote managment (51)
Devices usually installed in data-centres so that equipment can be managed or monitored remotely.

router (310)
A device that connects multiple networks. They are distinct from hubs and switches because they route packets between 2 different networks as opposed to extending one network.

security-misc (43)
Any device intended to protect other devices or networks that doesn't fall into the category of firewall. Examples include email filtering devices, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs), Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPSs) etc.

specialized (108)
The catch-all category. If a device doesn't fall into one of the other categories, it is specialized. Examples are very diverse and include everything from ethernet to serial bridges, oscilloscopes and other lab equipment, weather and climate monitors, and more.
*** Should ethernet->serial bridges be bridge category?

storage-misc (101)
Devices for storing data and making it accessible to clients over the network. Sometimes these are known as Network Attached Storage (NAS) devices.

switch (274)
A device that extends a network by selectively re-broadcasting packets. Switches are distinct from hubs which re-broadcast all packets.

telecom-misc (24)
Device used by telephone systems that aren't PBXs. Examples include Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer (DSLAM), Time Sharing User (TSU), and Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) systems.

terminal (9)
A device with a keyboard and monitor with the primary purpose of communicating directly with a terminal server or mainframe which is generally more powerful than a "dumb terminal".

terminal server (24)
A device that provides terminal facilities to clients over a network.

VoIP adapter (52)
A device for providing Voice Over IP (VoIP) service that doesn't itself include phone facilities. A phone must be plugged into these adapters to place or receive calls.

VoIP gateway (18)
A device that converts between VoIP protocols and normal telephone traffic. Also may convert different VoIP protocols.
Example: Avaya Office IP403 VoIP gateway

VoIP phone (81)
A device for providing Voice Over IP (VoIP) service that includes phone hardware.

WAP (298)
Wireless Access Points are devices that clients can use to connect to a network without using physical wires. Usually these devices use radio technology like 802.11b but sometimes they may use infra-red or other technology.

webcam (100)
A device that takes pictures with a camera, digitizes them, and makes them available over a network. This includes everything from consumer webcams used for internet chatting to Digital Video Recorders (DVRs) and professional security systems.

Proposed changes

Move X-ray machine (2) to specialized.

Move cluster (3) to specialized.

Move projector (3) to media device. I didn't find any projectors miscategorized
as "specialized" -David.

Move encryption accelerator (6) to proxy server.

Move web server (2) to general purpose or specialized.
