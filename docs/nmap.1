.\" Nmap: description of
.PP
Nmap (\(lqNetwork Mapper\(rq) is an open source tool for network exploration and security auditing\&. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks, although it works fine against single hosts\&. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics\&. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits, many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime\&.
.PP
The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with supplemental information on each depending on the options used\&. Key among that information is the
\(lqinteresting ports table\(rq\&..\" ports: \(lqinteresting\(rq
That table lists the port number and protocol, service name, and state\&. The state is either
\FCopen\F[],
\FCfiltered\F[],
\FCclosed\F[], or
\FCunfiltered\F[]\&.
\FCOpen\F[].\" open port state
means that an application on the target machine is listening for connections/packets on that port\&.
\FCFiltered\F[].\" filtered port state
means that a firewall, filter, or other network obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
\FCopen\F[]
or
\FCclosed\F[]\&.
\FCClosed\F[].\" closed port state
ports have no application listening on them, though they could open up at any time\&. Ports are classified as
\FCunfiltered\F[].\" unfiltered port state
when they are responsive to Nmap\'s probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are open or closed\&. Nmap reports the state combinations
\FCopen|filtered\F[].\" open|filtered port state
and
\FCclosed|filtered\F[].\" closed|filtered port state
when it cannot determine which of the two states describe a port\&. The port table may also include software version details when version detection has been requested\&. When an IP protocol scan is requested (\fB\-sO\fR), Nmap provides information on supported IP protocols rather than listening ports\&.
.PP
In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide further information on targets, including reverse DNS names, operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses\&.
.PP
A typical Nmap scan is shown in
Example\ \&15.1\&. The only Nmap arguments used in this example are
\fB\-A\fR, to enable OS and version detection, script scanning, and traceroute;
\fB\-T4\fR
for faster execution; and then the two target hostnames\&.

.SH "Target Specification"
.\" target specification
.PP
Everything on the Nmap command\-line that isn\'t an option (or option argument) is treated as a target host specification\&. The simplest case is to specify a target IP address or hostname for scanning\&.
.PP
Sometimes you wish to scan a whole network of adjacent hosts\&. For this, Nmap supports CIDR\-style.\" CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)
addressing\&. You can append /\fInumbits\fR
to an IPv4 address or hostname and Nmap will scan every IP address for which the first
\fInumbits\fR
are the same as for the reference IP or hostname given\&. For example, 192\&.168\&.10\&.0/24 would scan the 256 hosts between 192\&.168\&.10\&.0 (binary:
\FC11000000 10101000 00001010 00000000\F[]) and 192\&.168\&.10\&.255 (binary:
\FC11000000 10101000 00001010 11111111\F[]), inclusive\&. 192\&.168\&.10\&.40/24 would scan exactly the same targets\&. Given that the host
\FCscanme\&.nmap\&.org\F[].\" scanme.nmap.org
is at the IP address 64\&.13\&.134\&.52, the specification scanme\&.nmap\&.org/16 would scan the 65,536 IP addresses between 64\&.13\&.0\&.0 and 64\&.13\&.255\&.255\&. The smallest allowed value is /0, which scans the whole Internet\&. The largest value is /32, which scans just the named host or IP address because all address bits are fixed\&.
.\" address ranges
.PP
CIDR notation is short but not always flexible enough\&. For example, you might want to scan 192\&.168\&.0\&.0/16 but skip any IPs ending with \&.0 or \&.255 because they may be used as subnet network and broadcast addresses\&. Nmap supports this through octet range addressing\&. Rather than specify a normal IP address, you can specify a comma\-separated list of numbers or ranges for each octet\&. For example, 192\&.168\&.0\-255\&.1\-254 will skip all addresses in the range that end in \&.0 or \&.255, and 192\&.168\&.3\-5,7\&.1 will scan the four addresses 192\&.168\&.3\&.1, 192\&.168\&.4\&.1, 192\&.168\&.5\&.1, and 192\&.168\&.7\&.1\&. Either side of a range may be omitted; the default values are 0 on the left and 255 on the right\&. Using
\FC\-\F[]
by itself is the same as 0\-255, but remember to use 0\- in the first octet so the target specification doesn\'t look like a command\-line option\&. Ranges need not be limited to the final octets: the specifier 0\-255\&.0\-255\&.13\&.37 will perform an Internet\-wide scan for all IP addresses ending in 13\&.37\&. This sort of broad sampling can be useful for Internet surveys and research\&.
.PP
IPv6 addresses can only be specified by their fully qualified IPv6 address or hostname\&. CIDR and octet ranges aren\'t supported for IPv6 because they are rarely useful\&.
.PP
Nmap accepts multiple host specifications on the command line, and they don\'t need to be the same type\&. The command
\fBnmap scanme\&.nmap\&.org 192\&.168\&.0\&.0/8 10\&.0\&.0,1,3\-7\&.\-\fR
does what you would expect\&.
.PP
While targets are usually specified on the command lines, the following options are also available to control target selection:
.PP
\fB\-iL \fR\fB\fIinputfilename\fR\fR (Input from list) .\" -iL .\" target specification: from list
.RS 4
Reads target specifications from
\fIinputfilename\fR\&. Passing a huge list of hosts is often awkward on the command line, yet it is a common desire\&. For example, your DHCP server might export a list of 10,000 current leases that you wish to scan\&. Or maybe you want to scan all IP addresses
\fIexcept\fR
for those to locate hosts using unauthorized static IP addresses\&. Simply generate the list of hosts to scan and pass that filename to Nmap as an argument to the
\fB\-iL\fR
option\&. Entries can be in any of the formats accepted by Nmap on the command line (IP address, hostname, CIDR, IPv6, or octet ranges)\&. Each entry must be separated by one or more spaces, tabs, or newlines\&. You can specify a hyphen (\FC\-\F[]) as the filename if you want Nmap to read hosts from standard input rather than an actual file\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-iR \fR\fB\fInum hosts\fR\fR (Choose random targets) .\" -iR .\" random targets .\" target specification: at random
.RS 4
For Internet\-wide surveys and other research, you may want to choose targets at random\&. The
\fInum hosts\fR
argument tells Nmap how many IPs to generate\&. Undesirable IPs such as those in certain private, multicast, or unallocated address ranges are automatically skipped\&. The argument
\FC0\F[]
can be specified for a never\-ending scan\&. Keep in mind that some network administrators bristle at unauthorized scans of their networks and may complain\&. Use this option at your own risk! If you find yourself really bored one rainy afternoon, try the command

.PP
\fB\-\-exclude \fR\fB\fIhost1\fR\fR\fB[,\fIhost2\fR[,\&.\&.\&.]]\fR (Exclude hosts/networks) .\" --exclude .\" excluding targets
.RS 4
Specifies a comma\-separated list of targets to be excluded from the scan even if they are part of the overall network range you specify\&. The list you pass in uses normal Nmap syntax, so it can include hostnames, CIDR netblocks, octet ranges, etc\&. This can be useful when the network you wish to scan includes untouchable mission\-critical servers, systems that are known to react adversely to port scans, or subnets administered by other people\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-excludefile \fR\fB\fIexclude_file\fR\fR (Exclude list from file) .\" --excludefile
.RS 4
This offers the same functionality as the
\fB\-\-exclude\fR
option, except that the excluded targets are provided in a newline, space, or tab delimited
\fIexclude_file\fR
rather than on the command line\&.
.RE
.SH "Host Discovery"
.\" host discovery
.PP
One of the very first steps in any network reconnaissance mission is to reduce a (sometimes huge) set of IP ranges into a list of active or interesting hosts\&. Scanning every port of every single IP address is slow and usually unnecessary\&. Of course what makes a host interesting depends greatly on the scan purposes\&. Network administrators may only be interested in hosts running a certain service, while security auditors may care about every single device with an IP address\&. An administrator may be comfortable using just an ICMP ping to locate hosts on his internal network, while an external penetration tester may use a diverse set of dozens of probes in an attempt to evade firewall restrictions\&.
.PP
Because host discovery needs are so diverse, Nmap offers a wide variety of options for customizing the techniques used\&. Host discovery is sometimes called ping scan, but it goes well beyond the simple ICMP echo request packets associated with the ubiquitous
ping
tool\&. Users can skip the ping step entirely with a list scan (\fB\-sL\fR) or by disabling ping (\fB\-PN\fR), or engage the network with arbitrary combinations of multi\-port TCP SYN/ACK, UDP, and ICMP probes\&. The goal of these probes is to solicit responses which demonstrate that an IP address is actually active (is being used by a host or network device)\&. On many networks, only a small percentage of IP addresses are active at any given time\&. This is particularly common with private address space such as 10\&.0\&.0\&.0/8\&. That network has 16 million IPs, but I have seen it used by companies with less than a thousand machines\&. Host discovery can find those machines in a sparsely allocated sea of IP addresses\&.
.PP
If no host discovery options are given, Nmap sends a TCP ACK packet destined for port 80 and an ICMP echo request query to each target machine\&. An exception to this is that an ARP scan is used for any targets which are on a local ethernet network\&. For unprivileged Unix shell users, a SYN packet is sent instead of the ACK using the
\fBconnect\fR
system call\&..\" unprivileged users: limitations of
These defaults are equivalent to the
\fB\-PA \-PE\fR
options\&. This host discovery is often sufficient when scanning local networks, but a more comprehensive set of discovery probes is recommended for security auditing\&.
.PP
The
\fB\-P*\fR
options (which select ping types) can be combined\&. You can increase your odds of penetrating strict firewalls by sending many probe types using different TCP ports/flags and ICMP codes\&. Also note that ARP discovery (\fB\-PR\fR).\" -PR
is done by default against targets on a local ethernet network even if you specify other
\fB\-P*\fR
options, because it is almost always faster and more effective\&.
.PP
By default, Nmap does host discovery and then performs a port scan against each host it determines is online\&. This is true even if you specify non\-default host discovery types such as UDP probes (\fB\-PU\fR)\&. Read about the
\fB\-sP\fR
option to learn how to perform only host discovery, or use
\fB\-PN\fR
to skip host discovery and port scan all target hosts\&. The following options control host discovery:
.PP
\fB\-sL\fR (List Scan) .\" -sL .\" list scan
.RS 4
The list scan is a degenerate form of host discovery that simply lists each host of the network(s) specified, without sending any packets to the target hosts\&. By default, Nmap still does reverse\-DNS resolution on the hosts to learn their names\&. It is often surprising how much useful information simple hostnames give out\&. For example,
\FCfw\&.chi\F[]
is the name of one company\'s Chicago firewall\&.
.\" DNS: records as source of information
Nmap also reports the total number of IP addresses at the end\&. The list scan is a good sanity check to ensure that you have proper IP addresses for your targets\&.

The reason for offering both SYN and ACK ping probes is to maximize the chances of bypassing firewalls\&. Many administrators configure routers and other simple firewalls to block incoming SYN packets except for those destined for public services like the company web site or mail server\&.

TCP connect scan is the default TCP scan type when SYN scan is not an option\&. This is the case when a user does not have raw packet privileges or is scanning IPv6 networks\&.

When SYN scan is available, it is usually a better choice\&. Nmap has less control over the high level

ports\&. Page 65 of RFC 793 says that
\(lqif the [destination] port state is CLOSED \&.\&.\&.\&. an incoming segment not containing a RST causes a RST to be sent in response\&.\(rq
Then the next page discusses packets sent to open ports without the SYN, RST, or ACK bits set, stating that:
\(lqyou are unlikely to get here, but if you do, drop the segment, and return\&.\(rq
.sp
When scanning systems compliant with this RFC text, any packet not containing SYN, RST, or ACK bits will result in a returned RST if the port is closed and no response at all if the port is open\&. As long as none of those three bits are included, any combination of the other three (FIN, PSH, and URG) are OK\&. Nmap exploits this with three scan types:
.PP
Null scan (\fB\-sN\fR)

.sp
These three scan types are exactly the same in behavior except for the TCP flags set in probe packets\&. If a RST packet is received, the port is considered
\FCclosed\F[], while no response means it is
\FCopen|filtered\F[]\&. The port is marked
\FCfiltered\F[]
if an ICMP unreachable error (type 3, code 1, 2, 3, 9, 10, or 13) is received\&.
.sp
The key advantage to these scan types is that they can sneak through certain non\-stateful firewalls and packet filtering routers\&. Another advantage is that these scan types are a little more stealthy than even a SYN scan\&. Don\'t count on this though\(emmost modern IDS products can be configured to detect them\&. The big downside is that not all systems follow RFC 793 to the letter\&. A number of systems send RST responses to the probes regardless of whether the port is open or not\&. This causes all of the ports to be labeled
\FCclosed\F[]\&. Major operating systems that do this are Microsoft Windows, many Cisco devices, BSDI, and IBM OS/400\&. This scan does work against most Unix\-based systems though\&. Another downside of these scans is that they can\'t distinguish
\FCopen\F[]
ports from certain

\FCopen|filtered\F[]\&.

The ACK scan probe packet has only the ACK flag set (unless you use
\fB\-\-scanflags\fR)\&. When scanning unfiltered systems,
\FCopen\F[]

\FCclosed\F[]
is undetermined\&. Ports that don\'t respond, or send certain ICMP error messages back (type 3, code 1, 2, 3, 9, 10, or 13), are labeled

\fB\-sW\fR (TCP Window scan) .\" -sW .\" window scan
.RS 4
Window scan is exactly the same as ACK scan except that it exploits an implementation detail of certain systems to differentiate open ports from closed ones, rather than always printing
\FCunfiltered\F[]
when a RST is returned\&. It does this by examining the TCP Window field of the RST packets returned\&. On some systems, open ports use a positive window size (even for RST packets) while closed ones have a zero window\&. So instead of always listing a port as
\FCunfiltered\F[]
when it receives a RST back, Window scan lists the port as
\FCopen\F[]
or
\FCclosed\F[]
if the TCP Window value in that reset is positive or zero, respectively\&.
.sp
This scan relies on an implementation detail of a minority of systems out on the Internet, so you can\'t always trust it\&. Systems that don\'t support it will usually return all ports
\FCclosed\F[]\&. Of course, it is possible that the machine really has no open ports\&. If most scanned ports are
\FCclosed\F[]
but a few common port numbers (such as 22, 25, 53) are
\FCfiltered\F[], the system is most likely susceptible\&. Occasionally, systems will even show the exact opposite behavior\&. If your scan shows 1000 open ports and three closed or filtered ports, then those three may very well be the truly open ones\&.

Nmap has the ability to port scan or version scan multiple hosts in parallel\&. Nmap does this by dividing the target IP space into groups and then scanning one group at a time\&. In general, larger groups are more efficient\&. The downside is that host results can\'t be provided until the whole group is finished\&. So if Nmap started out with a group size of 50, the user would not receive any reports (except for the updates offered in verbose mode) until the first 50 hosts are completed\&.
.sp
By default, Nmap takes a compromise approach to this conflict\&. It starts out with a group size as low as five so the first results come quickly and then increases the groupsize to as high as 1024\&. The exact default numbers depend on the options given\&. For efficiency reasons, Nmap uses larger group sizes for UDP or few\-port TCP scans\&.

When a maximum group size is specified with

When Nmap receives no response to a port scan probe, it could mean the port is filtered\&. Or maybe the probe or response was simply lost on the network\&.

If Nmap detects poor network reliability, it may try many more times before giving up on a port\&. While this benefits accuracy, it also lengthen scan times\&.

Nmap\'s dynamic timing does a good job of finding an appropriate speed at which to scan\&. Sometimes, however, you may happen to know an appropriate scanning rate for a network, or you may have to guarantee that a scan will be finished by a certain time\&. Or perhaps you must keep Nmap from scanning too quickly\&. The
\fB\-\-min\-rate\fR
and
\fB\-\-max\-rate\fR
options are designed for these situations\&.
.sp
When the
\fB\-\-min\-rate\fR
option is given Nmap will do its best to send packets as fast as or faster than the given rate\&. The argument is a positive real number representing a packet rate in packets per second\&. For example, specifying
\fB\-\-min\-rate 300\fR
means that Nmap will try to keep the sending rate at or above 300 packets per second\&. Specifying a minimum rate does not keep Nmap from going faster if conditions warrant\&.

\fB\-\-max\-rate\fR
limits a scan\'s sending rate to a given maximum\&. Use
\fB\-\-max\-rate 100\fR, for example, to limit sending to 100 packets per second on a fast network\&. Use

\fB\-\-max\-rate\fR
together to keep the rate inside a certain range\&.
.sp
These two options are global, affecting an entire scan, not individual hosts\&. They only affect port scans and host discovery scans\&. Other features like OS detection implement their own timing\&.
.sp
There are two conditions when the actual scanning rate may fall below the requested minimum\&. The first is if the minimum is faster than the fastest rate at which Nmap can send, which is dependent on hardware\&. In this case Nmap will simply send packets as fast as possible, but be aware that such high rates are likely to cause a loss of accuracy\&. The second case is when Nmap has nothing to send, for example at the end of a scan when the last probes have been sent and Nmap is waiting for them to time out or be responded to\&. It\'s normal to see the scanning rate drop at the end of a scan or in between hostgroups\&. The sending rate may temporarily exceed the maximum to make up for unpredictable delays, but on average the rate will stay at or below the maximum\&.
.sp
Specifying a minimum rate should be done with care\&. Scanning faster than a network can support may lead to a loss of accuracy\&. In some cases, using a faster rate can make a scan take
\fIlonger\fR
than it would with a slower rate\&. This is because Nmap\'s

adaptive retransmission
algorithms will detect the network congestion caused by an excessive scanning rate and increase the number of retransmissions in order to improve accuracy\&. So even though packets are sent at a higher rate, more packets are sent overall\&. Cap the number of retransmissions with the

People could access all of their home systems from work, changing the climate control settings or unlocking the doors for early guests\&. This vision of universal connectivity has been stifled by address space shortages and security concerns\&. In the early 1990s, organizations began deploying firewalls for the express purpose of reducing connectivity\&. Huge networks were cordoned off from the unfiltered Internet by application proxies, network address translation, and packet filters\&. The unrestricted flow of information gave way to tight regulation of approved communication channels and the content that passes over them\&.

\fB\-f\fR (fragment packets); \fB\-\-mtu\fR (using the specified MTU) .\" -f .\" --mtu
.RS 4
The
\fB\-f\fR
option causes the requested scan (including ping scans) to use tiny fragmented IP packets\&. The idea is to split up the TCP header over several packets to make it harder for packet filters, intrusion detection systems, and other annoyances to detect what you are doing\&. Be careful with this! Some programs have trouble handling these tiny packets\&. The old\-school sniffer named Sniffit segmentation faulted immediately upon receiving the first fragment\&. Specify this option once, and Nmap splits the packets into eight bytes or less after the IP header\&. So a 20\-byte TCP header would be split into three packets\&. Two with eight bytes of the TCP header, and one with the final four\&. Of course each fragment also has an IP header\&. Specify
\fB\-f\fR
again to use 16 bytes per fragment (reducing the number of fragments)\&..\" -f: giving twice
Or you can specify your own offset size with the
\fB\-\-mtu\fR
option\&. Don\'t also specify
\fB\-f\fR
if you use
\fB\-\-mtu\fR\&. The offset must be a multiple of eight\&. While fragmented packets won\'t get by packet filters and firewalls that queue all IP fragments, such as the
\fICONFIG_IP_ALWAYS_DEFRAG\fR
option in the Linux kernel, some networks can\'t afford the performance hit this causes and thus leave it disabled\&. Others can\'t enable this because fragments may take different routes into their networks\&. Some source systems defragment outgoing packets in the kernel\&. Linux with the iptables.\" iptables
connection tracking module is one such example\&. Do a scan while a sniffer such as
Wireshark.\" Wireshark
is running to ensure that sent packets are fragmented\&. If your host OS is causing problems, try the
\fB\-\-send\-eth\fR.\" --send-eth
option to bypass the IP layer and send raw ethernet frames\&.
.sp
Fragmentation is only supported for Nmap\'s raw packet features, which includes TCP and UDP port scans (except connect scan and FTP bounce scan) and OS detection\&. Features such as version detection and the Nmap Scripting Engine generally don\'t support fragmentation because they rely on your host\'s TCP stack to communicate with target services\&.

.RS 4
Causes a decoy scan to be performed, which makes it appear to the remote host that the host(s) you specify as decoys are scanning the target network too\&. Thus their IDS might report 5\(en10 port scans from unique IP addresses, but they won\'t know which IP was scanning them and which were innocent decoys\&. While this can be defeated through router path tracing, response\-dropping, and other active mechanisms, it is generally an effective technique for hiding your IP address\&.
.sp
Separate each decoy host with commas, and you can optionally use
\FCME\F[].\" ME (decoy address)
as one of the decoys to represent the position for your real IP address\&. If you put
\FCME\F[]
in the sixth position or later, some common port scan detectors (such as Solar Designer\'s.\" Solar Designer
excellent Scanlogd).\" Scanlogd
are unlikely to show your IP address at all\&. If you don\'t use
\FCME\F[], Nmap will put you in a random position\&. You can also use
\FCRND\F[].\" RND (decoy address)
to generate a random, non\-reserved IP address, or
\FCRND:\fInumber\fR\F[]
to generate
\fInumber\fR
addresses\&.
.sp
Note that the hosts you use as decoys should be up or you might accidentally SYN flood your targets\&. Also it will be pretty easy to determine which host is scanning if only one is actually up on the network\&. You might want to use IP addresses instead of names (so the decoy networks don\'t see you in their nameserver logs)\&.
.sp
Decoys are used both in the initial ping scan (using ICMP, SYN, ACK, or whatever) and during the actual port scanning phase\&. Decoys are also used during remote OS detection (\fB\-O\fR)\&. Decoys do not work with version detection or TCP connect scan\&. When a scan delay is in effect, the delay is enforced between each batch of spoofed probes, not between each individual probe\&. Because decoys are sent as a batch all at once, they may temporarily violate congestion control limits\&.
.sp
It is worth noting that using too many decoys may slow your scan and potentially even make it less accurate\&. Also, some ISPs will filter out your spoofed packets, but many do not restrict spoofed IP packets at all\&.

Another possible use of this flag is to spoof the scan to make the targets think that

\fB\-e\fR

\fB\-PN\fR

.RS 4
One surprisingly common misconfiguration is to trust traffic based only on the source port number\&. It is easy to understand how this comes about\&. An administrator will set up a shiny new firewall, only to be flooded with complains from ungrateful users whose applications stopped working\&. In particular, DNS may be broken because the UDP DNS replies from external servers can no longer enter the network\&. FTP is another common example\&. In active FTP transfers, the remote server tries to establish a connection back to the client to transfer the requested file\&.
.sp
Secure solutions to these problems exist, often in the form of application\-level proxies or protocol\-parsing firewall modules\&. Unfortunately there are also easier, insecure solutions\&. Noting that DNS replies come from port 53 and active FTP from port 20, many administrators have fallen into the trap of simply allowing incoming traffic from those ports\&. They often assume that no attacker would notice and exploit such firewall holes\&. In other cases, administrators consider this a short\-term stop\-gap measure until they can implement a more secure solution\&. Then they forget the security upgrade\&.
.sp
Overworked network administrators are not the only ones to fall into this trap\&. Numerous products have shipped with these insecure rules\&. Even Microsoft has been guilty\&. The IPsec filters that shipped with Windows 2000 and Windows XP contain an implicit rule that allows all TCP or UDP traffic from port 88 (Kerberos)\&. In another well\-known case, versions of the Zone Alarm personal firewall up to 2\&.1\&.25 allowed any incoming UDP packets with the source port 53 (DNS) or 67 (DHCP)\&.
.sp
Nmap offers the
\fB\-g\fR
and
\fB\-\-source\-port\fR
options (they are equivalent) to exploit these weaknesses\&. Simply provide a port number and Nmap will send packets from that port where possible\&. Nmap must use different port numbers for certain OS detection tests to work properly, and DNS requests ignore the
\fB\-\-source\-port\fR
flag because Nmap relies on system libraries to handle those\&. Most TCP scans, including SYN scan, support the option completely, as does UDP scan\&.

.RS 4
The
\m[blue]\fBIP protocol\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[10]\d\s+2
offers several options which may be placed in packet headers\&. Unlike the ubiquitous TCP options, IP options are rarely seen due to practicality and security concerns\&. In fact, many Internet routers block the most dangerous options such as source routing\&. Yet options can still be useful in some cases for determining and manipulating the network route to target machines\&. For example, you may be able to use the record route option to determine a path to a target even when more traditional traceroute\-style approaches fail\&. Or if your packets are being dropped by a certain firewall, you may be able to specify a different route with the strict or loose source routing options\&.
.sp
The most powerful way to specify IP options is to simply pass in values as the argument to
\fB\-\-ip\-options\fR\&. Precede each hex number with
\FC\ex\F[]
then the two digits\&. You may repeat certain characters by following them with an asterisk and then the number of times you wish them to repeat\&. For example,
\FC\ex01\ex07\ex04\ex00*36\ex01\F[]
is a hex string containing 36 NUL bytes\&.
.sp
Nmap also offers a shortcut mechanism for specifying options\&. Simply pass the letter
\FCR\F[],
\FCT\F[], or
\FCU\F[]
to request record\-route,.\" record route IP option
record\-timestamp,.\" record timestamp IP option

.SH "Output"
.\" output formats
.PP
Any security tools is only as useful as the output it generates\&. Complex tests and algorithms are of little value if they aren\'t presented in an organized and comprehensible fashion\&. Given the number of ways Nmap is used by people and other software, no single format can please everyone\&. So Nmap offers several formats, including the interactive mode for humans to read directly and XML for easy parsing by software\&.
.PP
In addition to offering different output formats, Nmap provides options for controlling the verbosity of output as well as debugging messages\&. Output types may be sent to standard output or to named files, which Nmap can append to or clobber\&. Output files may also be used to resume aborted scans\&.
.PP
Nmap makes output available in five different formats\&. The default is called
interactive output,.\" interactive output
and it is sent to standard output (stdout)\&..\" standard output
There is also
normal output,.\" normal output
which is similar to interactive except that it displays less runtime information and warnings since it is expected to be analyzed after the scan completes rather than interactively\&.
.PP
XML output.\" XML output
is one of the most important output types, as it can be converted to HTML, easily parsed by programs such as Nmap graphical user interfaces, or imported into databases\&.
.PP
The two remaining output types are the simple
grepable output.\" grepable output
which includes most information for a target host on a single line, and
sCRiPt KiDDi3 0utPUt.\" scR1pT kIddI3 output
for users who consider themselves |<\-r4d\&.
.PP
While interactive output is the default and has no associated command\-line options, the other four format options use the same syntax\&. They take one argument, which is the filename that results should be stored in\&. Multiple formats may be specified, but each format may only be specified once\&. For example, you may wish to save normal output for your own review while saving XML of the same scan for programmatic analysis\&. You might do this with the options
\fB\-oX myscan\&.xml \-oN myscan\&.nmap\fR\&. While this chapter uses the simple names like
\FCmyscan\&.xml\F[]
for brevity, more descriptive names are generally recommended\&. The names chosen are a matter of personal preference, though I use long ones that incorporate the scan date and a word or two describing the scan, placed in a directory named after the company I\'m scanning\&.
.PP
While these options save results to files, Nmap still prints interactive output to stdout as usual\&. For example, the command
\fBnmap \-oX myscan\&.xml target\fR
prints XML to
\FCmyscan\&.xml\F[]
and fills standard output with the same interactive results it would have printed if
\fB\-oX\fR
wasn\'t specified at all\&. You can change this by passing a hyphen character as the argument to one of the format types\&. This causes Nmap to deactivate interactive output, and instead print results in the format you specified to the standard output stream\&. So the command
\fBnmap \-oX \- target\fR
will send only XML output to stdout\&..\" output: to stdout with -
Serious errors may still be printed to the normal error stream, stderr\&..\" standard error
.PP
Unlike some Nmap arguments, the space between the logfile option flag (such as
\fB\-oX\fR) and the filename or hyphen is mandatory\&. If you omit the flags and give arguments such as
\fB\-oG\-\fR
or
\fB\-oXscan\&.xml\fR, a backwards compatibility feature of Nmap will cause the creation of
\fInormal format\fR
output files named
\FCG\-\F[]
and
\FCXscan\&.xml\F[]
respectively\&.
.PP
All of these arguments support
\fBstrftime\fR\-like.\" strftime conversions in filenames
conversions in the filename\&.
\FC%H\F[],
\FC%M\F[],
\FC%S\F[],
\FC%m\F[],
\FC%d\F[],
\FC%y\F[], and
\FC%Y\F[]
are all exactly the same as in
\fBstrftime\fR\&.
\FC%T\F[]
is the same as
\FC%H%M%S\F[],
\FC%R\F[]
is the same as
\FC%H%M\F[], and
\FC%D\F[]
is the same as
\FC%m%d%y\F[]\&. A
\FC%\F[]
followed by any other character just yields that character (\FC%%\F[]
gives you a percent symbol)\&. So
\fB\-oX \'scan\-%T\-%D\&.xml\'\fR
will use an XML file in the form of
\FCscan\-144840\-121307\&.xml\F[]\&.

\m[blue]\fB\%http://nmap.org/data/nmap.dtd\fR\m[]\&.
.sp
XML offers a stable format that is easily parsed by software\&. Free XML parsers are available for all major computer languages, including C/C++, Perl, Python, and Java\&. People have even written bindings for most of these languages to handle Nmap output and execution specifically\&. Examples are

This output format is covered last because it is deprecated\&. The XML output format is far more powerful, and is nearly as convenient for experienced users\&. XML is a standard for which dozens of excellent parsers are available, while grepable output is my own simple hack\&. XML is extensible to support new Nmap features as they are released, while I often must omit those features from grepable output for lack of a place to put them\&.
.sp
Nevertheless, grepable output is still quite popular\&. It is a simple format that lists each host on one line and can be trivially searched and parsed with standard Unix tools such as grep, awk, cut, sed, diff, and Perl\&. Even I usually use it for one\-off tests done at the command line\&. Finding all the hosts with the SSH port open or that are running Solaris takes only a simple grep to identify the hosts, piped to an awk or cut command to print the desired fields\&.
.sp
Grepable output consists of comments (lines starting with a pound (#)).\" grepable output: comments in

\FCIgnored State\F[],
\FCOS\F[],
\FCSeq Index\F[],

The most important of these fields is generally

Warnings and errors printed by Nmap usually go only to the screen (interactive output), leaving any normal\-format output files (usually specified with

\fB\-6\fR
option\&. Of course, you must use IPv6 syntax if you specify an address rather than a hostname\&. An address might look like
\FC3ffe:7501:4819:2000:210:f3ff:fe03:14d0\F[], so hostnames are recommended\&. The output looks the same as usual, with the IPv6 address on the

While IPv6 hasn\'t exactly taken the world by storm, it gets significant use in some (usually Asian) countries and most modern operating systems support it\&.
