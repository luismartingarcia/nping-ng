TODO $Id: TODO 11866 2009-01-24 23:10:05Z fyodor $ -*-text-*-

o Consider making the TODO list public
  o Probably remove all of the "done" items since that is easier than
    reviewing them.
  o Might as well add to insecure.org/nmap/data/
  o Maybe a bug tracker is a better approach.

o Deal with new Python 2.6 Zenmap build warnings:
  C:\Python26\lib\site-packages\py2exe\build_exe.py:16: DeprecationWarning: the sets module is deprecated
  import sets

o NSE should offer some way to sleep/yeield for a given amount of
  time.  This would allow other scripts to run while a script has
  nothing to do.  Possible uses:
  o Many services have rate limits (or you might just want to use them
    for politeness).  For example, a web site spidering application
    might want to limit HTTP requests to some number per second to avoid
    pissing off the target webmaster more than is necessary (or prevent
    getting auto-blocked).  Similarly, whois servers often will block
    IPs which query them too often in a short period.  Or maybe you
    don't want to exceed the threshold limits of an IDS.

o Find way to document NSE library script arguments and perhaps have
  them bubble up to scripts themselves.  For example, I had to read
  the SNMP library source code to determine the script argument to
  specify the SNMP community name for snmp-sysdescr
  (http://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/snmp-sysdescr.html).  Maybe we could
  just standardize on something like we do with SMB library and the
  scripts which call it (http://nmap.org/nsedoc/modules/smb.html,
  http://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smb-check-vulns.html). [David]

o Look into memory consumption of UDP scans with -p- and large
  hostgroups.  See if there is a way to prevent them from eating up gigs
  of RAM.

o Write Ncat users' guide, demonstrating all the neat stuff you can do
  with it.  This should probably be in DocBook XML so it can be an NNS
  chapter.  You might want to query nmap-dev for ieas of neat things
  people do with ncat (or look around for what people do with nc).
  Testing it out for examples might expose areas for improvement as
  well. [David]

o Fix the directory function(s) in nse_fs.cc to be usable by scripts and
  improve flexibility. [this entry added by Patrick]

o NSE Performance in general

o Look into whether we should loosen/change the global congestion
  control system to address possible cases of one target host with many
  dropped packets slowing down the whole group.  See
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q1/0096.html .
  o One possibility: Look into whether we should increase the
    frequency of port scan pings.  See
    http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q1/0096.html . Note that Fyodor
    already increased them a bit in 2008.  Might not need more.
  o Related possibility: Fix --nogcc to gracefully handle ping scans.
    Right now it seems to go WAY TOO FAST (e.g. severqal thousand
    packets per second on my DSL line).

o Ask Coverity if they'll scan latest version of Nmap.

o Start project to make Nmap a Featured Article on Wikipedia.

o Add Nmap web board.
 
o Create Nmap wiki

o Look at Dario Ciccarone's email from 5/1/07 about IPID sequence
  issues, and consider adding IPID sequence test for closed-port-tcp as
  they apparently can be different.

o libnmap organization for UNIX and Windows
  o Then change Nmap and Zenmap to simply call this library

o Open proxy NSE script?

o [NSE] We may want to consider a better exception handling method -- one
  which doesn't require wrapping every I/O line in its own try function
  call.

o Consider adding boolean expressions to --script arguments.  For
  example, see Patrick's implementation at
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q3/0300.html .

o Figure out what to do about NSE mutexes:
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q3/0276.html .

o Consider whether to let Zenmap Topology graph export the images to
  svg/png/etc.  Also think about printing.

o Perhaps --traceroute should set currenths->distance because right
  now, I do an -O scan against scanme.nmap.org, and it does not figure
  out the distance.  So the fingerprint shows no distance element and
  Nmap doesn't print "Network Distance" in the results line.  That may
  be OK (Nmap probably isn't receiving the probe response needed for
  this, and maybe doesn't want to print the TG), but even when I do
  --traceroute I get no distance printed.  Yet Nmap clearly knows the
  distance since the traceroute shows all the hops up to and including
  the target (scanme.nmap.org).

o Look into building RPMs with SSL support. Statically linking to
  OpenSSL on Linux for the RPMs didn't work for me last time I
  tried. [Fyodor]

o Improve the "run Zenmap as root" menu item to work on distributions
  without su-to-root.  We might even want to improve Zenmap so that it
  itself does not have to run as root, and just executes Nmap that
  way.  Rather than not showing Zenmap as root on the Menu of
  non-working systems, it might be better to have it but let it give
  an error message (and then, perhaps, run as nonroot) so that users
  of those distributions are more likely to contribute a fix.  We also
  might want to look at how the distributions themselves package Zenmap.

o Change Nmap signature files to use the .sig extension rather than
  .gpg.txt, as that seems to be what gpg recommends.  In fact, gpg
  will automatically verify the right file if it exists after dropping
  the .sig (or .asc) extension.  I may need to configure .htaccess to
  serve .sig files properly.  Update nmap-install.xml
  accordingly. Suggested by tic at eternalrealm.net by email on 7/13/08.

o Fix this overflow:
  Stats: 93:57:40 elapsed; 254868 hosts completed (2048 up), 2048 undergoing UDP Scan
  UDP Scan Timing: About 11.34% done; ETC: 03:21 (-688:-41:-48 remaining)

o Do -p- Internet UDP scans.

o Consider adding the rtt value for each host, at least in verbose
  mode, to Nmap output.

o NSE-INF: Would be great if NSE scripts could be made to NOT run as
  root.

o Look a bit more at default version detection timing.

o Deal with UDP retransmission for version detection ( I think I
  should just do a second run of all probes for UDP if it fails to
  match anything).  The advantage there is that no retransmissions are
  neccessary if the service is found.  Then again, per-probe
  retransmission would let us redo the most likely probes (the one(s)
  that match the port number) quickly.  Lost packets should probably
  affect ideal_parallelism.

o Figure out why I [Fyodor] get a bunch of "Operation not permitted" errors
when I launch a scan on SYN such as: 
   /home/fyodor/nmap-exp/fyodor-perf/nmap -nogcc -T4 -n -v -p- --portpingfreq 250 -oA /home/fyodor/nmap-misc/logs/WorldScan/portpingfreq/logs/portpingfreq-250-1%T-%D 67.15.236.34 67.15.236.36 81.174.236.66 81.174.236.119 170.140.20.160 170.140.20.174 202.138.180.9 202.138.180.17 202.138.180.132 209.20.64.112
   The errors look like:
sendto in send_ip_packet: sendto(7, packet, 44, 0, 170.140.20.174, 16) => Operation not permitted
Offending packet: TCP 64.13.134.4:59820 > 170.140.20.174:59120 S ttl=39 id=19927 iplen=44  seq=2425535549 win=4096 <mss 1460>

Discovered open port 49394/tcp on 170.140.20.174
sendto in send_ip_packet: sendto(7, packet, 44, 0, 170.140.20.174, 16) => Operation not permitted

   May be related to connection tracking and high scan rates. See
   http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q4/0652.html

o Get better password data for unpw -- perhaps from Solar Designer.

o Consider making the ping scan default be more comprehensive.  Note
  that I got 23% more Internet boxes found out of a 50K sample (see host
  enumeration chapter of my book for details).  Maybe I should
  experiment a bit more to ensure they are real boxes and not network
  artifacts and figure out exactly which tests are helping the most.
  If I do this change, I'll have to update the host enumeration chapter.

o Nmaprc-related - Create a system to store Nmap defaults/preferences
  in an nmaprc file.
  o nmaprc should be in ~/.nmap on UNIX
  o On Windows, we may need a registry key to find the .nmaprc
  o Obtain Nmap data directory information from nmaprc at runtime rather than
    compiled in -- among other advantages this is needed to make
    relocateable rpm.
  o Make RPM relocatable (requires somehow avoiding storing paths in the
    binary)
  o Perhaps Lua could be used for the TODO?
  o .nmaprc for keeping defaults, etc.
    o Nmaprc infrastructure, hook to new timing variables
    o Nmaprc man page
    o Default timing mode
    o Default NSE arguments, such as user agent
    o Maybe Default source IP (-S) argument
    o should be a way to specify your own .nmaprc
    o Maybe lets you add a directory and template for saving all
     scans. 

o Search for nmap on google news, on google web, and add appropriate
  links to press page and the like.

o Maybe nping -- like hping2 but uses Nmap infrastructure and to a
  large degree the same command-line options as Nmap.

o Think about Nmap or NSE http framework.  Scanning http paths to see
  if they exist is in some ways similar to scanning to see which ports
  are open.

o Website: Create shr (shared) directory in svn, which will contain
  directories shared between the Insecure.org network of sites
  (e.g. templates, error, css).  Then sites such as sectools,
  nmap.org, insecure.org can just check that out via externals
  declaration (or, I suppose, symlink).  CSS directives will then use
  /shr/css/insecdb.css etc. ). [Fyodor]

o NSE Security Review
 o Consider what, if any, vulnerabilities or security risks NSE has
   with respect to buffer overflows, format string bugs, any other
   maliciously formatted responses from target systems, etc.  Maybe
   address the known risk of malicious scripts too.
 o Consider that NSE runs scripts as root

o Zenmap script selection interface for deciding which NSE scripts to
  run.

o Get new Zenmap logo
 o consider putting back on top-right of command constructor wizard
 (there used to be umit logo there).
 o Maybe that can be done after the release by soliciting ideas.

o Make Zenmap splash screen

o nmap.cgi web interface for Nmap
  -- Should have "demo" mode that only allows users to scan their own addy

o Create or collect some great ./configure ascii art.

o Add randomizer to configure script so that a random ASCII art from
  docs/leet-nmap-ascii-art*.txt is printed.  I think I'll start naming
  them leet-nmap-ascii-art-submittername.txt.

o [Note: This one is too big to do right now, but is a good one to
  keep in mind for later ]
  Write a general scanning engine for abusing applications for port
  scanning purposes. This would handle scanning through SOCKS and HTTP
  proxies, and the existing FTP bounce scan would also be ported to this
  engine. Proxy chaining must be supported.  According to
  rembrandt@jpberlin.de, you can also do this with the "forwarding"
  commands on imap servers.
  o Before you start on this one, read the code for the main port
  scanning engine code (ultra_scan()) and also the version detection
  code (service_scan()).  And the version detection paper at
  http://www.insecure.org/nmap/vscan/ .  If you understand all that,
  you may be ready for this project :).  This is important, because it
  is easy to do poorly.  The tough part is high performance and clean
  code which is general enough that all these different applications
  can be scanned through using the same basic engine.
  o You may want to run your intended structure (the most important
    Classes and such through nmap-dev before you begin serious coding).

o Add general regression unit testing system to Nmap

o Talk to Libpcap folks about incorporating (at least some of) my
  changes from libpcap/NMAP_MODIFICATIONS.

o Add --evil to set the RFC3514 evil bit.
  ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc3514.txt
  o We're not going to add this right now.

o The Nmap web page is beginning to show its age.  Ah, who am I
  kidding, it was showing its age 5 years ago :).  It could do with an
  upgrade to XHTML+CSS.  It could also do with a whole redesign, but I
  think that can be done as a second step after converting to
  XHTML+CSS with roughly the same look.  Though adding a few more
  modern touches (like hover interaction on the menu bar) wouldn't
  hurt.  This is a moderatly big project, which will involve: o
  Designing the new XHTML+CSS to look similar to the current HTML
  pages, but be extensible enough that it can be redesigned in the
  (near) future by mostly just changing the CSS and graphics.  
    o Converting the existing Nmap pages to the new XHTML format.
      This will likely include using open source programs and likely
      modifying them or creating your own scripts to help with the
      process.  To apply for this task, you need to have some web
      development experience and an example XHTML+CSS web page you
      have created online.

o Provide an option to send a comment in scan packet data for target
  network.  Examples: --comment "Scan conducted by Marc Reis from
  SecOps, extension 2147" or --comment "pH33r my l3eT
  s|&lt;iLLz!  I'll 0wN UR b0x!"
  o Note, this shouldn't be implemented yet.

o I should add code to Nmap to bail if sizeof(char) isn't 1.
  Otherwise there could be security risks if it is not one on any
  platforms.

o consider changing status field from "up" and "down" to "online" and
  "offline".

o I need an output-autoflush option of some sort.  This could be
  useful to ensure I get all the --packet_trace and debug data before
  Nmap crashes.  Actually, I'm not sure that is so critical.

o Consider implementing RPC scan with ultra_scan or something else.
  Right now it is the only program using pos_scan.  On the other hand,
  I'm not sure TCP rpc scanning is appropriate for ultra_scan.

o Look at all the pcap functions, there are some like
  pcap_findalldevs() which could be quite useful.  There are mails to
  the Nmap list relating to suggested improvements --
  http://seclists.org/lists/nmap-dev/2004/Apr-Jun/0024.html .
  Actually I do indirectly use that for Windows. I wonder if they work
  for UNIX?

o Update Nmap entry on Linux Online -
  http://www.linux.org/apps/AppId_1979.html

o Proxy scan through
  o Note mail from mugz about proxy scanning:
    > #1 I use nmap to find "open" socks ports (stealth/random mode)
    > #2 I use Sockcheck5 (which uses an existing proxy to run its
    >    scan through) to determine which of the "open" ports are "unsecure"
    > #3 I use sockbounce (or sockbounce4) which can be used to relay from
    >    socks proxy to socks proxy to target and estabish tcp connections,
    >    (telnet, ssh http, etc).
    His later mail says:
    > during that time, i found many 'open'  - a fairly high percentage,
    > perhaps one in 30 were insecure.
    > you might want to take a look at: http://blitzed.org/bopm/
    > I use code from this to check the IP's with 'open' socks ports for
    > insecurity (I had to tinker with it a bit to make it work like i wanted,
    > the command line "bopchecker" seems to work well.


o perhaps each 'match' line in nmap-service-probes should have a
  maximum lines, bytes, and/or time by which a response should be
  available.  Once that much time (or many bytes or lines) have passed,
  that match can be considered 'failed' and ignored in subsequent runs.
  Once all matches are considered failed, that probe is done.  This
  could be a useful optimization and is arguably better than the less
  granular 'totalwaitms'.  Or I could just have a simple function that
  looks at whether a given regex could possibly match something
  starting with the received data (not too hard since almost all of
  the current regexes are anchored).  But before doing this, I should
  look long and hard at how many of the probes have every match
  capable of doing this.  In particular, many of the softmatch lines
  don't offer many chars anchored at the front.

o Add detection of duplicate machines via IP.ID uber-technique.
   Maybe I should use uptime timestamps too.  Oh, and MAC addresses too.

o Separate nbase into its own Windows library in the same way as Andy did
   with iphlpapi .

o Look into iplog ( http://ojnk.sourceforge.net/ ) -z option which is 
  supposed to fool OS detection.

o security audit of Nmap code

o Nmap / Nmap-hackers FAQ

o random tip database
