<para>Nmap can often be installed or upgraded with a single command,
so don't let the length of this chapter scare you.  Most readers will
use the table of contents to skip
directly to sections that concern them.  This chapter describes how to install
Nmap on many platforms, including both source
code compilation and binary installation methods.  Graphical and
command-line versions of Nmap are described and contrasted.
Nmap removal instructions are also provided in case you change your
mind.</para>

<sect2 id="inst-already"><title>Testing Whether Nmap is Already Installed</title>
<indexterm><primary>Nmap</primary><secondary>checking if installed</secondary></indexterm>
<para>The first step toward obtaining Nmap is to check whether you already
have it.  Many free operating system distributions (including most
Linux and BSD systems) come with Nmap packages, although they may not be
installed by default.  On Unix systems, open a terminal window and try executing the command
<command>nmap <option>--version</option></command>.
If Nmap exists and is in your
<envar>PATH</envar>,<indexterm><primary><envar>PATH</envar> environment variable</primary></indexterm>
you should see output similar to that in <xref linkend="ex-checking-for-nmap" xrefstyle="select: label nopage" />.</para>

<para>If Nmap does <emphasis>not</emphasis>
exist on the system (or if your <envar>PATH</envar> is incorrectly

<computeroutput>nmap: Command not found</computeroutput> is reported.  As the
example above shows, Nmap responds to the command by printing its
version number (here <literal>4.76</literal>).</para>

<para>Even if your system already has a copy of Nmap, you should
consider upgrading to the latest version available from <ulink

<sect2 id="inst-interfaces"><title>Command-line and Graphical Interfaces</title>

<para>Nmap has traditionally been a command-line tool run from
a Unix shell or (more recently) Windows command prompt.  This allows
experts to quickly execute a command that does exactly what they want
without having to maneuver through a bunch of configuration panels and
scattered option fields.  This also makes Nmap easier to script and
enables easy sharing of useful commands among the user
community.</para>

<para>One downside of the command-line approach is that it can be
intimidating for new and infrequent users.
Nmap offers more than a hundred
command-line options, although many are obscure features or debugging
controls that most users can ignore.  Many graphical frontends have been
created for those users who prefer a GUI interface.  Nmap has traditionally included a simple GUI for Unix named <application>NmapFE</application><indexterm><primary>NmapFE</primary></indexterm>, but that was replaced in 2007 by Zenmap,
which we have been developing since 2005.  Zenmap is far more powerful and effective than NmapFE, particularly in results viewing.  Zenmap's tab-based interface lets you search and sort
results, and also browse them in several ways (host details, raw Nmap
output, and ports/hosts).  It works on Linux, Windows, Mac
OS X, and other platforms.  Zenmap is covered in depth in <xref linkend="zenmap"/>.  The rest of this book focuses on command-line Nmap invocations.
Once you understand how the
command-line options work and can interpret the output, using Zenmap or
the other available Nmap GUIs is easy.  Nmap's options work the same way
whether you choose them from radio buttons and menus or type them at a
command-line.

<sect2 id="inst-download"><title>Downloading Nmap</title>

<indexterm significance="preferred"><primary>downloading</primary></indexterm>
<para>Nmap.Org is the official source for downloading Nmap source
code and binaries for Nmap and Zenmap.  Source code is distributed in
bzip2 and gzip compressed tar files, and binaries are available for
Linux (RPM format), Windows (NSIS executable installer) and Mac OS X (<filename>.dmg</filename> disk image). Find all of this at <ulink

<sect2 id="inst-integrity"><title>Verifying the Integrity of Nmap Downloads</title>

<indexterm><primary>verifying the integrity of downloads</primary></indexterm>
<para>It often pays to be paranoid about the
integrity of files downloaded from the Internet.  Popular packages
such as Sendmail (<ulink
url="http://cert.org/advisories/CA-2002-28.html">example</ulink>),
OpenSSH (<ulink
url="http://cert.org/advisories/CA-2002-24.html">example</ulink>),
tcpdump, Libpcap, BitchX, Fragrouter, and many others have been
infected with malicious trojans.  Software distributions sites at the
Free Software Foundation, Debian, and SourceForge have also been
successfully compromised.  This has never happened to Nmap, but one
should always be careful.  To verify the authenticity of an Nmap
release, consult the PGP detached signatures or cryptographic hashes
(including SHA1 and MD5) posted for the release in the Nmap signatures
directory at <ulink
url="http://nmap.org/dist/sigs/?C=M&amp;O=D"/>.</para>

<para>The most secure verification mechanism is detached PGP<indexterm><primary>PGP signatures</primary></indexterm>
signatures.  As the signing key is never stored on production servers,
even someone who successfully compromises the web server couldn't
forge and properly sign a trojan release.  While numerous applications
are able to verify PGP signatures, I recommend <ulink

Nmap releases are signed with a special

which can be obtained from the major keyservers or <ulink

included in that file too.  The keys can be imported with the command
<command>gpg --import nmap_gpgkeys.txt</command>.  You only need to do
this once, then you can verify all future Nmap releases from that
machine.  Before trusting the
keys, verify that the fingerprints match the values shown in <xref

<para>While PGP signatures are the recommended validation technique,
SHA1 and MD5 (among other)
hashes<indexterm><primary>hashes, cryptographic</primary></indexterm><indexterm><primary>digests, cryptographic</primary></indexterm>
are made available for more casual
validation.  An attacker who can manipulate your Internet traffic in
real time (and is extremely skilled) or who compromises Nmap.Org
and replaces both the distribution file and digest file, could defeat
this test.  However, it can be useful to check the authoritative
Nmap.Org hashes if you obtain Nmap from a third party or feel it
might have been accidentally corrupted.  For every Nmap package download
file, there is a corresponding file in the <filename>sigs</filename> directory with
<literal>.digest.txt</literal> appended to the name
(e.g. <filename>nmap-4.76.tar.bz2.digest.txt</filename>).  An example
is shown in <xref linkend="ex-digest-file" xrefstyle="select: label nopage" />.  This is the detached
signature file. The hashes from the digest file can be verified using common tools such as
<application>sha1sum</application>, <application>md5sum</application>,
or <application>gpg</application>, as shown in <xref

<para>While releases from Nmap.Org are signed as described in this

<sect2 id="inst-svn"><title>Obtaining Nmap from the Subversion (SVN) Repository</title>
<indexterm><primary>Subversion</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>SVN</primary><see>Subversion</see></indexterm>

<para>In addition to regular stable and development releases, the
latest Nmap source code is always available using the <ulink
url="http://subversion.tigris.org">Subversion (SVN) revision control
system</ulink>.  This delivers new features and version/OS detection
database updates immediately as they are developed.  The downside is that
SVN head revisions aren't always as stable as official releases.  So
SVN is most useful for Nmap developers and users who need a fix which
hasn't yet been formally released.</para>

<para>
SVN write access is strictly limited to top Nmap
developers, but everyone has read access to the repository.  Check out
the latest code using the command <command>svn co --username guest
--password "" svn://svn.insecure.org/nmap/</command>.  Then you can later
update your source code by typing <command>svn up</command> in your
working directory.  The <quote>guest</quote> username is required due to an svnserve authorization bug.</para>

<para>While most users only follow the <filename>/nmap</filename>
directory in svn (which pulls
in <filename>/nbase</filename>, <filename>/nsock</filename>,
and <filename>/zenmap</filename> on its own), there is one other
interesting directory: <filename>/nmap-exp</filename>.  This directory
contains <emphasis>experimental</emphasis> Nmap branches which Nmap
developers create when they wish to try new things without
destabilizing Nmap proper.  When developers feel that an experimental
branch is ready for wider-scale testing, they will generally email the
location to the <citetitle>nmap-dev</citetitle> mailing list.</para>

<para>Once Nmap is checked out, you can build it from source code just as you would with the Nmap tarball (described later in this chapter).</para>

<para>If you would like real-time (or digested) notification and diffs by email when any
changes are made to Nmap, sign up for the nmap-svn mailing

While binary packages
(discussed in later sections) are available for most platforms, compilation and
installation from source code is the traditional and most powerful way
to install Nmap.  This ensures that the
latest version is available and allows Nmap
to adapt to the library availability and directory structure of your
system.  For example, Nmap uses the
OpenSSL cryptography libraries for version detection when
available, but most binary packages do not include this
functionality.  On the other hand, binary packages are generally
quicker and easier to install, and allow for consistent management
(installation, removal, upgrading, etc.) of all packaged software on the system.</para>

<para>Source installation is usually a painless process&mdash;the build system is designed to auto-detect as much as possible.  Here are the steps required for a default install:</para>

<para>With GNU tar, the simpler command <command>tar xvjf
nmap-<replaceable>VERSION</replaceable>.tar.bz2</command> does the
trick.  If you downloaded the .tgz version, replace
<application>bzip2</application> with <application>gzip</application>
in the decompression command.</para></listitem>

Nmap then expects the library files to be in <filename><replaceable>directoryname</replaceable>/lib</filename> and the include files to be in <filename><replaceable>directoryname</replaceable>/include</filename>.

<sect1 id="inst-linux"><title>Linux Distributions</title>

<para>
Linux is the most popular platform for running Nmap.  In one user
survey, 86% said that Linux was at least one of the platforms on which
they run Nmap.  The first release of Nmap in
1997 <emphasis>only</emphasis> ran on Linux.</para>

<para>Linux users can choose between a source code install or using
binary packages provided by their distribution or Insecure.Org.  The
binary packages are generally quicker and easier to install, and are
often slightly customized to use the distribution's standard directory
paths and such.  These packages also allow for consistent management
in terms of upgrading, removing, or surveying software on the system.
A downside is that packages created by the distributions are
necessarily behind the Nmap.Org source releases.  Most Linux
distributions (particularly Debian and Gentoo) keep their Nmap package
relatively current, though a few are way out of date.  Choosing the
source install allows for more flexibility in determining how Nmap is
built and optimized for your system.  To build Nmap from source, see
<xref linkend="inst-source" />.  Here are simple package instructions
for the most common distributions.</para>

just the command-line executable and data files, while the
<literal>zenmap</literal> package contains the optional <application>Zenmap</application>
graphical frontend (see <xref linkend="zenmap"/>).
The <literal>zenmap</literal> package requires
that the <literal>nmap</literal> package be installed first.  One down
side to installing the RPMs rather than compiling from source is that
the RPMs don't support OpenSSL for version detection and Nmap Scripting Engine probing of SSL services.</para>

These binaries won't work for the relatively few Linux users on other platforms such as SPARC, Alpha, or PowerPC.  They also may refuse to install if your library versions are sufficiently different from what the RPMs were initially built on.  One option in these cases would be to find binary RPMs prepared by your Linux vendor for your specific distribution.  The original install CDs or DVD are a good place to start.  Unfortunately, those may not be current or available.  Another option is to install Nmap from source code as described previously, though you lose the binary package maintenance consistency benefits.  A third option is to build and install your own binary RPMs from the source RPMs distributed from the download page above.  <xref linkend="ex-nmap-install-from-srpms" xrefstyle="select: label nopage" /> demonstrates this technique with Nmap 4.68.</para>

<para>The Red Hat, Fedora, Mandrake, and Yellow Dog Linux
distributions have an application named <application>Yum</application>
which manages software installation and updates from central RPM
repositories.  This makes software installation and updates trivial.
Since distribution-specific Yum repositories are normally used, you
know the software has already been tested for compatibility with your
particular distribution.  Most distributions do maintain Nmap in their
Yum repository, but they don't always keep it up to date.  This is
particularly problematic if you (like most people) don't always
quickly update to the latest release of your distribution.  If you are
running a two-year old Linux release, Yum will often give you a
two-year-old version of Nmap.  Even the latest version of
distributions often take months to update to a new Nmap release.  So
for the latest version of Nmap on these systems, try the RPMs we
distribute as described in the previous section.  But if our
RPMs aren't compatible with your system or you are in a great hurry,
installing Nmap from Yum is usually as simple as executing
<command>yum install nmap</command> (run <command>yum install nmap zenmap</command>
if you would like the GUI too, though some distributions don't yet package Zenmap).  Yum takes care of contacting a
repository on the Internet, finding the appropriate package for
your architecture, and then installing it along with any necessary
dependencies.  This is shown (edited for brevity) in <xref
linkend="ex-nmap-install-from-yum" xrefstyle="select: label nopage" />.  You can later perform
<command>yum update</command> to install available updates to Nmap and other
packages in the repository.</para>

<para>While Nmap was once a Unix-only tool, a Windows version was
released in 2000 and has since become the second most popular Nmap
platform (behind Linux). Because of this popularity and the fact that
many Windows users do not have a compiler, binary executables are
distributed for each major Nmap release.  While it has improved
dramatically, the Windows port is not quite as efficient or stable as
on Unix.  Here are some known limitations:
</para>


<indexterm><primary>Windows</primary><secondary>limitations of</secondary></indexterm>
<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>You cannot generally scan your own machine from itself
(using a loopback<indexterm><primary>loopback
interface</primary></indexterm> IP such as 127.0.0.1 or any of its
registered IP addresses).  This is a Windows limitation that we
haven't yet worked around.  If you really want to do this, use a TCP
connect scan without pinging (<option>-sT -PN</option>) as that uses
the high level socket API rather than sending raw
packets.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Nmap only supports ethernet interfaces (including most
802.11 wireless cards and many VPN clients) for raw packet scans.
Unless you use the <option>-sT -PN</option> options, RAS connections
(such as PPP dialups) and certain VPN clients are not supported.  This
support was dropped when Microsoft removed raw TCP/IP socket support
in Windows XP SP2.  Now Nmap must send lower-level ethernet frames
instead.</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>

<indexterm><primary>Windows</primary><secondary>performance of</secondary></indexterm>
<para>Scans speeds on Windows are generally comparable to those on
Unix, though the latter often has a slight performance edge.  One
exception to this is connect scan (<option>-sT</option>), which is
often much slower on Windows because of deficiencies in the Windows
networking API.  This is a shame, since that is the one TCP scan that
works against localhost and over all networking types (not just
ethernet, like the raw packet scans).  Connect scan performance can be
improved substantially by applying the Registry changes in the
<filename>nmap_performance.reg</filename> file included with Nmap.  By default these changes are applied for you by the Nmap executable installer.  This registry file
is in the <filename>nmap-<replaceable>version</replaceable></filename>
directory of the Windows binary zip file, and
<filename>nmap-<replaceable>version</replaceable>/mswin32</filename>
in the source tarball (where <replaceable>version</replaceable> is the
version number of the specific release).  These changes increase
the number of ephemeral ports reserved for user applications (such as
Nmap) and reduce the time delay before a closed connection can
be reused.  Most people simply check the box to apply these changes in the executable Nmap installer, but you can also apply them by double-clicking on
<filename>nmap_performance.reg</filename>, or by running the command
<command>regedit32 nmap_performance.reg</command>.  To make the changes by hand, add these three Registry DWORD values to
the <literal>CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters</literal> entry under <literal>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM</literal>:</para>

does an excellent job of maintaining

on his site, and are generally very simple: download the
appropriate Nmap package for your version
of Solaris, decompress it, and then run <command>pkgadd -d <replaceable>packagename</replaceable></command>.
As is generally the case with contributed binary packages, these
Solaris packages are simple and quick to install.  The advantages of
compiling from source are that a newer version may be available and
you have more flexibility in the build process.

<indexterm><primary>uninstallation</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>removal</primary></indexterm>

<para>If your purpose for removing Nmap is
simply to upgrade to the latest version, you can usually use the
upgrade option provided by most binary package managers.  Similarly,
installing the latest source code (as described in <xref
linkend="inst-source" />) generally overwrites any
previous from-source installations.  Removing Nmap is a good idea if
you are changing install methods (such as from source to RPM or vice
versa) or if you are not using Nmap anymore and you care about the few
megabytes of disk space it consumes.</para>

<para>How to remove Nmap depends on how
you installed it initially (see previous sections).  Ease of removal (and other maintenance) is a major advantage of most binary packages.  For example, when Nmap is installed using
the RPM<indexterm><primary>RPM</primary></indexterm>
system common on Linux distributions, it can be removed by
running the command <command>rpm -e nmap
zenmap</command> as root.  Analogous options are offered by
most other package managers&mdash;consult their documentation for further
information.</para>

<para>If you installed Nmap from the Windows installer, simply open the <application>Control Panel</application>, select <quote>Add or Remove Programs</quote> and select the <quote>Remove</quote> button for Nmap.  You can also remove WinPcap unless you need it for other applications such as Wireshark.</para>

<para>If you installed Nmap from source
code, removal is slightly more difficult.  If you still have the build
directory available (where you initially ran <command>make
install</command>), you can remove Nmap by
running <command>make uninstall</command>.  If you no longer have that
build directory, type <command>nmap -V</command> to
obtain the Nmap version number.  Then
download that source tarball for that version of
Nmap from <ulink url="http://nmap.org/dist/" /> or <ulink url="http://nmap.org/dist-old/" />.
Uncompress the tarball and change into the newly created directory
(<filename>nmap-<replaceable>version</replaceable></filename>).  Run
<command>./configure</command>, including any install-path options that you specified
the first time (such as <option>--prefix</option> or
<option>--datadir</option>).  Then run <command>make
uninstall</command>.  Alternatively, you can simply delete all the
Nmap-related files.  If you used a default source install of Nmap
versions 4.50 or higher, the following commands remove it.</para>
<screen>
# cd /usr/local
# rm -f bin/nmap bin/nmapfe bin/xnmap
# rm -f man/man1/nmap.1 man/man1/zenmap.1
# rm -rf share/nmap
# ./bin/uninstall_zenmap
</screen>
<para>You may have to adjust the above commands slightly if you
specified <option>--prefix</option> or other install-path option when
first installing Nmap.  The files relating to zenmap, nmapfe, and xnmap do not exist if you did not install the <application>Zenmap</application> frontend.</para>
