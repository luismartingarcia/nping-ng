This file is a list of the licenses of the third-party software used by
Nmap and the other tools distributed with it. What follows is a
description of each third-party package. At the end of this file is the
license of each. The license of Nmap itself is in the COPYING file.

On all platforms, Nmap is normally linked with:
 o libpcap: Network packet capture library. Distributed with Nmap in the
   libpcap subdirectory.
   http://www.tcpdump.org/
 o libdnet: Networking library, used for low-level tasks such as sending
   ethernet frames. A modified version is distributed with Nmap in the
   libdnet-stripped subdirectory. A summary of Nmap-local modifications
   is in the file NMAP_MODIFICATIONS.
   http://code.google.com/p/libdnet/
 o PCRE: Perl-compatible regular expressions. PCRE is part of Nmap's
   version detection and is also made available as an NSE library.
   Distributed with Nmap in the libpcre subdirectory.
   http://www.pcre.org/
 o liblua: Lua programming language. Lua is the implementation language
   of NSE, the Nmap Scripting Engine. Nmap links with liblua to allow
   running Lua programs inside Nmap. Distributed with Nmap in the liblua
   subdirectory. liblua can be omitted by configuring with the
   --without-liblua configuration directive.
   http://www.lua.org/
 o OpenSSL: Cryptographic library. OpenSSL is used by service detection
   and by NSE to connect to SSL services. NSE also provides access to
   OpenSSL functions such as encryption and digest calculation. A binary
   copy of the OpenSSL library for Windows is distributed with Nmap in
   the subdirectory mswin32/OpenSSL. OpenSSL can be disabled by
   configuring with the --without-openssl configuration directive.
   http://www.openssl.org/

On Windows only, Nmap uses:
 o WinPcap: libpcap for Windows. The libpcap license applies to WinPcap,
   and it also has its own license. A binary copy of the library is
   distributed with Nmap in the subdirectory mswin32/winpcap.
   http://www.winpcap.org/

Zenmap and Ndiff require:
 o Python. The binary distributions of Nmap include a Python interpreter
   and various libraries, built using either py2exe or py2app.
   http://www.python.org/

The Windows and Mac OS X binary packages include bundled versions of:
 o GLib, GTK+, ATK, Pango: These libraries are licensed under the GNU
   LGPL 2, a copy of which is in this directory in the file LGPL-2.
 o PyGTK: GTK+ bindings for Python. Licensed under the GNU LGPL 2.1, a
   copy of which is in this directory in the file LGPL-2.1.

The Mac OS binary packages also include:
 o Various X.org libraries. These were built using MacPorts.
   http://www.x.org/ http://www.macports.org/

PCRE LICENCE
------------

PCRE is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax
and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.

Release 7 of PCRE is distributed under the terms of the "BSD" licence, as
specified below. The documentation for PCRE, supplied in the "doc"
directory, is distributed under the same terms as the software itself.

The basic library functions are written in C and are freestanding. Also
included in the distribution is a set of C++ wrapper functions.

  LICENSE ISSUES
  ==============

  The OpenSSL toolkit stays under a dual license, i.e. both the conditions of
  the OpenSSL License and the original SSLeay license apply to the toolkit.
  See below for the actual license texts. Actually both licenses are BSD-style
  Open Source licenses. In case of any license issues related to OpenSSL
  please contact openssl-core@openssl.org.
