Nping AUTHORS
===============

Nping was originally written from the ground up by Luis MartinGarcia
(luis.mgarc@gmail.com), during the Google Summer of Code program in 2009. Luis
was mentored by Fyodor.

Further development was done in the Google Summer of Code 2010 by Luis
once again mentored by Fyodor. 

Many helpful comments, suggestions and other useful information were taken from 
the nmap-dev list (@insecure.org) as well as other contributors via email.

Nping shares the Nmap infrastructure libraries (Nsock and Nbase) which were
originally written by Fyodor.
