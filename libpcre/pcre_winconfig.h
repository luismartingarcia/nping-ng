longer patterns in extreme cases. On Unix systems, "configure" can be used to

catch runaway regular expressions that take for ever to determine that they do
not match. The default is set very large so that it does not accidentally catch
legitimate cases. On Unix systems, "configure" can be used to override this
default default. */
