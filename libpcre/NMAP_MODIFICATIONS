This directory contains a version of LibPCRE 7.6 that has been stripped
down to less than a third of its original uncompressed size.  So if you
want docs, tests and such, you should go to the PCRE website at
http://www.pcre.org .  Here are the changes for the Nmap version:

o Started this NMAP_MODIFICATIONS file

o Removed these directories:
cmake
doc
testdata

o Removed these files:
pcretest.c
pcregrep.c
pcredemo.c
RunGrepTest
RunTest
RunTest.bat
perltest.pl
Detrail
PrepareRelease
libpcre.pc.in
libpcrecpp.pc.in
pcre_printint.src
CMakeLists.txt
config-cmake.h.in

o Got rid of the C++ wrapper, which included this step:
  rm -f *.cc pcrecpparg.h.in pcrecpp.h pcrecpp_internal.h pcre_scanner.h pcre_stringpiece.h.in

o Copied pcre.h.generic to pcre.h and pcre_chartables.c.dist to, you
  guessed it, pcre_chartables.c (for Windows).  Running ./configure in
  UNIX just overwrites them with other ones. Made the rule that makes
  pcre_chartables.c copy pcre_chartables.c.dist instead of making a
  symbolic link to it. Remove pcre_chartables.c from CLEANFILES.

o Stripped down Makefile.am and configure.ac substantially to remove
  libtool dependency (was having trouble on Mac OS X), remove Windows
  stuff (Nmap uses a custom MS VC project for this), and insure it only
  worries about building libpcre.a (which is now build in the libpcre
  directory rather than in libpcre/.libs ).  Removed quite a bit of
  unneeded things from these files, as well as adding -fno-thread-jumps
  when compiling on Mac OS X on Intel (original patch: Kurt Grutzmacher
  grutz(a)jingojango.net).  [The diff is FAR too large to included here]

o Removed config.sub, config.guess, depcomp, install-sh, and missing.
  These files are found in the parent (i.e., Nmap's) directory.

o Comment out some build configuration lines from pcre_internal.h because Nmap
  builds a static library:

o Added pcre_winconfig.h for Windows.  LibPCRE used to include config.h in
  pcre_internal.h, and we'd include this winconfig there instead of config.h
  if WIN32 is defined.  Now, however, they've moved config.h includes to a
  bunch of different files, so we have to change them.  We could remove the
  other includes and move it back to pcre_internal.h, but they must've moved
  them for a reason, so we'll follow them.  Occurrences of

#ifdef HAVE_CONFIG_H
#include "config.h"
#endif

  get changed to

#ifdef WIN32
#include "pcre_winconfig.h"
#else
#include "config.h"
#endif
