This is Dug Song's excellent Libdnet networking library version 1.10.
It has been stripped down for inclusion within Nmap as follows:

o Removed the following directories:
  python, test, man

o Removed all filenames from EXTRA_libdnet_la_SOURCES sources, as
  they aren't needed with GNU automake 1.9.2

o Removed files in now-removed dires that were reference from
  configure.in:318

o Ran "aclocal -I . -I config" to regenerate aclocal.m4 with my newer
  aclocal.

o Replaced config.guess config.sub and missing in config dir with
  versions from Autoconf 2.59.

o Added this NMAP_MODIFICATIONS file.
